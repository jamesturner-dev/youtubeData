# youtubeData

This is the repository where I am storing the raw json files I scrape Youtube for.  

Youtube is one of the most signifigant stores of data in history, I am collecting subsets weekly.

The csv and json files in the root directory contain the entire dataset.  The csv files are the same as the json files, but in csv format.  The combinedTopics.csv is the data before it was cleaned up.  

The files in /json/ and /csv/ are the individual topical files named for the topic searched for.

The notebooks folder holds a couple of the notebooks I used like scratch paper to clean up the data. I'll upload the actual Python scripts I used to scrape and clean the data soon.
