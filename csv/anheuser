https://www.mockquestions.com/company...

************************************************************************************************
0:00 - Introduction
0:23 - Question #1: Anheuser-Busch prefers to hire those with a true interest in our products. What is your favorite beer that we sell? What do you like about it?
1:04 - Question #2: At Anheuser-Busch, we believe that our employees should exceed their own expectations. How do you challenge yourself in the workplace?
1:46 - Question #3: At Anheuser-Busch, we are a company of owners. Tell me about a time when you’ve taken ownership of a project.
2:50 - Question #4: Anheuser-Busch puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of a healthy work-life balance. How do you create a good balance for yourself?
3:44 - Question #5: Teamwork is important to us. Give me an example of a time you collaborated with a coworker to accomplish a goal. Did you enjoy the experience?

************************************************************************************************
1) Anheuser-Busch prefers to hire those with a true interest in our products. What is your favorite beer that we sell? What do you like about it?

Answer Example:
""I love Budweiser because it reminds me of going fishing with my dad. It's light and refreshing, plus my dad loves it! Budweiser is the only beer my dad has been drinking for the past 30 years! What is your favorite beer product?""

2)  At Anheuser-Busch, we believe that our employees should exceed their own expectations. How do you challenge yourself in the workplace?

Answer Example:
""I enjoy working in a challenging environment, and I find myself setting goals for myself daily. Just the other day, I challenged myself to make 100 outbound calls to prospective clients. I ended up making 120, and that felt awesome!""

3) At Anheuser-Busch, we are a company of owners. Tell me about a time when you’ve taken ownership of a project. 

Answer Example:
""In my previous position, I took over as the client lead for one of our most profitable but demanding clients. While there were various people on my team contributing to projects for this client, I adopted the mindset that any failure to reach full potential ultimately landed on me, as I was the group leader. This helped me to maintain diligence and an eye for detail when working on client tasks. Client profitability increased by 22% in that first quarter as client lead.""

4) Anheuser-Busch puts a lot of emphasis on the importance of a healthy work-life balance. How do you create a good balance for yourself?

Answer Example:
""I ensure a good work-life balance by remaining organized and efficient during my work hours. This way, I am less likely to need to work overtime. I will often commit to fun events or activities on the weekend, which means that if I do not hit my weekly work targets, I do not get the time to attend that concert or that boxing class. This motivates me to be continually efficient during my work hours.""

5) Teamwork is important to us. Give me an example of a time you collaborated with a coworker to accomplish a goal. Did you enjoy the experience?

Answer Example:
""In one of my college marketing classes, we were divided into groups to come up with a brand strategy for a new product. I delegated responsibilities by asking each person in the group which aspect of branding they were most excited about. Even though each of us had a different role in the project, we communicated ideas and gave each other feedback on what would help us reach the overall goal. It was a great experience because we collaborated so well and created an awesome brand!""

It was thorough and we got to see a lot of the factory.  And the best part, they actually give you samples!  Free beer.  Not just one, but two! 

We went around the property.  Not only did they explain the process of beer making but they also explained the history of the company and the different buildings in the campus.  

Although we got there pretty late, we still got in the 5 pm tour.  They were very accommodating.  

At the end of the tour, you will be given a token which you can exchange for a glass of beer.  Yes, a full glass.  Vic got the ""Select"", which they said was only available in Missouri.  Irwin got the 319. He has never had it before.  We think they were both good.  Vic was a little citrus-y (light) and Irwin's has a hint of sweetness to it.  We were not disappointed :-).  And how could you be?  It was free!  :-)



WHO ARE WE?

We, Irwin and Victorina, have decided to quit our jobs, sell everything we have and go on an epic road trip of visiting all U.S. National Parks!  Follow our journey - from letting go of our material possessions, preparing for the extended camping trip, and even the mistakes, joys, doubts and adventures we make along the way! We hope to inspire others to appreciate the beauty of Planet Earth. 

Adventure begins in Feb 2017. We estimate this road trip will take us approximately 12 to 16 months.  We know we will some amazing places and meet a lot of interesting people.  

If you have an idea or suggestions for us for places to visit along the way, feel free to contact us!  


NEW VIDEOS every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. If we miss a day, it is probably because we had no phone signal inside the park or we couldn't find any wifi access.  If this is the case, we will upload our video as soon as we get any phone signal.

Why Budweiser Is No Longer The King Of Beer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ATjEgjcnA&pp=ygUIQW5oZXVzZXI%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q1ATjEgjcnA/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC,https://www.youtube.com/@CNBC,"Anheuser-Busch InBev is the world's largest brewer with 500 brands in more than 100 countries. In 2016, Flemish Interbrew and Brazilian Ambev, together known as InBev, merged with the American legacy company Anheuser-Busch, which ultimately brought AB under the leadership of 3G Capital. 3G Capital is a Brazilian-American global investment firm whose tactics include an aggressive, and at times controversial, cost-cutting strategy. AB InBev's longtime priority of aggressive acquisitions has been coupled with a focus on profit and price per barrel rather than volume share. Premiumization and expanding beyond beer continue to be winning strategies. In 2021, the company amassed $54.3 billion in revenue with 169,000 employees worldwide. As overall beer consumption has declined, AB InBev has transformed from merely a beer company to the largest beverage company in the world.

TAILGATE! Anheuser-Busch Amputates Budweiser Clydesdales’ Tailbones,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYAU6iyEFzQ&pp=ygUIQW5oZXVzZXI%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tYAU6iyEFzQ/maxresdefault.jpg,PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals),https://www.youtube.com/@peta,"Anheuser-Busch mutilates the famous Clydesdales by severing their tailbones when they’re foals. This is done primarily so the Budweiser Clydesdales will have a distinctive look. 

Horses subjected to tail amputation can’t protect themselves from flies or other biting insects, which causes lifetime stress and could increase their risk of being infected with West Nile virus or other pathogens. 

Horses also depend on their tails for mobility and to communicate. Tailbone amputation is so harmful that many European countries have completely banned it, as have 10 U.S. states, unless it’s medically necessary. Budweiser representatives disingenuously claim they do it for safety reasons so the tails won’t get caught on the wagon-pulling equipment. But many humane alternatives exist, including braiding and wrapping, both of which are common. There’s no excuse for animal abuse.  Help end the #Tailgate peta.org/Tailgate

The Tragic History Of The Anheuser-Busch Dynasty,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAscGVo13gY&pp=ygUIQW5oZXVzZXI%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NAscGVo13gY/maxresdefault.jpg,Grunge,https://www.youtube.com/@GrungeHQ,"Anhueser-Busch has been the biggest name in American beer since the 19th century. And over the long years, the descendants of Eberhard Anheuser and Adolphus Busch have each played their part in keeping the brewery at the top.

But they have also each played their part in weaving a tapestry of tragedy as well. From fatal illnesses, kidnappings, and car accidents, to suicide, accidental deaths, and manslaughter, the Anhueser-Busch families have faced one scandal after another, eventually leading to the loss of the company itself. So how did one of America's richest and most powerful families come to ruin? This is the tragic history of the Anheuser-Busch dynasty.
