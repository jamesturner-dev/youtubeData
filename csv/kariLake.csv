Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...""

RELATED: 'SNL': Megan Thee Stallion hosts, Jan. 6 hearings spoofed in cold open https://bit.ly/3gXNMsK

""Saturday Night Live"" took aim at controversial Republican candidates surging in midterm election races: Herschel Walker, Mehmet Oz and Kari Lake. During the sketch show's cold open Saturday, all three candidates were portrayed being interviewed by PBS's Judy Woodruff (Heidi Gardner) in an effort to get at the reasons for their recent success.

Kenan Thompson was introduced as former football star Walker, the gaffe-prone Senate candidate from Georgia. ""Hello, Judas. My name is Herschel Walker Texas Ranger and I’m running for president of the United Airlines,"" he said. The candidate did not have an explanation for his own recent poll gains.

""The whole world is a mystery, ain’t it?"" Thompson’s Walker said. ""For example, a thermos: It keeps the hot things hot but also the cold things cold. My question is, how do it decide? So we’re going to be looking into that very much.""

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...""

Kari Lake is presenting her case for why election results in Arizona's gubernatorial race should be overturned.

Lake's team has their cybersecurity expert on the stand claiming the printer issues on Election Day were due to the printer size image changed from 20-inches to 19-inches.

He claimed he could see it clearly during a ballot inspection that took place on Dec. 20, adding in court it could not have been an accident. 

In this two-day trial, Lake's team must prove not just that the election was poorly run, but that someone acted deliberately to alter the election and succeeded.

Kari Lake is presenting her case for why election results in Arizona's gubernatorial race should be overturned.

Lake's team has their cybersecurity expert on the stand claiming the printer issues on Election Day were due to the printer size image changed from 20-inches to 19-inches.

He claimed he could see it clearly during a ballot inspection that took place on Dec. 20, adding in court it could not have been an accident.

In this two-day trial, Lake's team must prove not just that the election was poorly run, but that someone acted deliberately to alter the election and succeeded.

Trump backed Republican Kari Lake hires lawyers to contest Arizona election loss,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJdSrJXRNGs&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xJdSrJXRNGs/maxresdefault.jpg,The Telegraph,http://www.youtube.com/@telegraph,"Refusing to concede, Kari Lake, the defeated Republican candidate for Arizona governor, said Thursday she is assembling lawyers and collecting evidence of voters having trouble casting ballots on Election Day as she considers her next move.

Lake, who was endorsed by Donald Trump, traveled to the former president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Thursday, her campaign spokesman told The Associated Press. The Washington Post first reported that she attended a luncheon held by the America First Policy Institute, an advocacy group created by former Trump advisers.

In a 2 1/2-minute video, Lake made no mention of giving up in her most extensive public comments since losing the election. Before the election, she had refused to say that she would concede if she lost the race to Democrat Katie Hobbs.

""Rest assured I have assembled the best and brightest legal team, and we are exploring every avenue to correct the many wrongs that have been done this past week,"" Lake said. ""I'm doing everything in my power to right these wrongs.""

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

""The Republican candidate for governor of Arizona told a big rally on Sunday she was not going to speak even metaphorically about the size of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ testicles.

“My staff always says whatever you do, do not say balls, so I’m not gonna say it,” Kari Lake said when introducing DeSantis at the Unite and Win rally at the Arizona Financial Theatre in Phoenix.

She tried saying instead, “That guy has a backbone made of steel…” But this was apparently not ballsy enough.

“I’ll tell you what he’s got,” Lake then said. “I don’t know if you heard of this, but he’s got BDE. Anybody know what that means? Ask your kids about it later.”

The roar from the crowd indicated that many of those in attendance knew without having to ask their children that BDE stands for Big Dick Energy. Lake spoke—one would hope—metaphorically about the size of DeSantis’ penis.

“I call it big DeSantis energy, right?” she continued, though she had on many occasions said that talk of gender wrongly sexualizes children.

She quickly added, “He’s got the same kind of BDE that President Trump has. And frankly, he has the same kind of BDE that we want all of our elected leaders to have.”

Former Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake heaped praise on former President Donald Trump as a ""bull in a China shop"" during a gala speech in which she repeatedly rejected the legitimacy of her electoral defeat last year.

Lake contended that there is a battle between the ""globalists vs. we the people"" and characterized Trump as the great champion on behalf of the people during a keynote address to hundreds of VIP guests at the Ronald Reagan dinner for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Her speech illustrated Trump's dominance at CPAC.

Kari Lake Claims ELECTION FRAUD After Ballot Counting Issues Affect 1 IN 3 Arizona Polling Locations,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb6q-R4qrI8&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Nb6q-R4qrI8/hqdefault.jpg,The Hill,http://www.youtube.com/@thehill,"Batya Ungar-Sargon and Robby Soave discuss Arizona attorney general's order for Maricopa County officials to submit a report on its handling of the Nov. 8 election, before the election in the state can be certified. #Arizona #MaricopaCounty #KariLake #KatieHobbs 

Donald Trump falsely claims that he won the 2020 election.  Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College and had a 4-point margin in the popular vote.

Maricopa Co. Election Officials said no voters had been disenfranchised, ballots that could not be scanned were placed in secure bins inside tabulating machines and will be delivered by bipartisan teams to the county’s central elections office.  According to Bill Gates, chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, the printing issue was a surprise and that the county plans to do a “deep dive” into why the issue wasn’t caught during testing.

Lake ran on a platform of election denial, saying she would only accept the results of the election if she won. How do you deal with an election denier? You beat 'em at the ballot box, which Katie Hobbs did by more than 17,000 votes. But then - following Donald Trump's playbook - Lake filed a law suit challenging the election's results. The next step to beating an election denier? You crush 'em in court. As Reuters reported, ""Arizona judge dismisses election denier Kari Lake's bid to overturn vote results."" These defeats suggest that election denialism may be on the ropes.

"Interviewing Kari Lake, the election denier who lost the race for Arizona governor - BBC News",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hw-UG3iFVzQ&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Hw-UG3iFVzQ/maxresdefault.jpg,BBC News,http://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews,"Trump ally Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for Arizona governor in the US midterms, says Donald Trump shouldn't have to run again to become president, because his election was stolen.

Early in her campaign, Lake won Trump's endorsement by placing herself on the conservative wing of the Republican party, and more importantly, by claiming the 2020 election was stolen, although there has been no evidence that it was.

Ms Lake spoke to the BBC's Katty Kay ahead of the elections earlier this month.

""Republican Kari Lake lost her bid to become Arizona’s next governor to Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs.

The race was called by NBC News on Monday night, nearly a week after the polls closed.

A political novice, the former TV news anchor notched the endorsement of Donald Trump during the Republican primary thanks in part by repeating his false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Lake had also signaled she would be unlikely to accept an election loss, though that is hardly relevant to the process.""

During day one of the trial, Lake's team brought up an expert that said he has proof ballots were intentionally printed incorrectly, but the county responded, saying every vote was still counted.

Lake did not talk outside of court, but inside, her team claimed a printing issue on Election Day was intentional and disenfranchised voters.

On the stand, Lake's team called Clay Parikh, with Northrop Grumman cybersecurity.

During a ballot inspection on Dec. 20 of 15 ballots, Parikh claimed he saw proof the ballots were actually 19-inch documents printed on 20-inch paper.

When asked how many of those contained 19-inch ballot image on 20-inch paper, Parikh replied, ""14.""

Maricopa County Elections Director Scott Jarrett said there is no 19-inch document.

""That ballot does not exist. The only ballot that exists is a 20-inch ballot.""

Parikh says it happened and it was deliberate.

When asked is there any way, in his opinion, for a 19-inch ballot to be projected on a 20-inch ballot by accident, Parikh said, ""No, sir."" Then he was asked, ""Why not?""

""Because the settings and the configurations and the procedures that are used cannot allow that,"" replied Parikh.

Jarrett responded, ""Again, you're asking me to speculate about things that I have no knowledge of occurring. So I don't know if it could have been a deliberate act or not. I don't believe that that occurred.""

Whether it was deliberate matters, but they need more.

In this trial, Lake's team must prove someone interfered in the election purposely and succeeded in changing the vote.

During the cross, county attorneys pointed out even if the ballots were 19-inches, deliberate or not, every vote was still counted.

An attorney asked, ""Are duplicated ballots tabulated? Maricopa County, General Election 2022?""

Parikh responded, ""If they're duplicated correctly, and they're configured correctly, yes, they should be.""

There were multiple hiccups for Lake's team. They attempted to call a witness, but never added him to the witness list, so he could not be called. Exhibits were listed, but never attached.

The governor’s race was called on Monday night, with Ms Hobbs taking leading the contest by about 20,000 votes and a 50.4 per cent majority to Ms Lake’s 49.6 per cent.

""Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake had a heated exchange with Fox News host Bret Baier on Monday evening after he asked her about about allegations that she was a drag queen's fan. 

Lake, who recently criticized drag queens, was called out by Richard Stevens, a popular drag queen from Phoenix who claimed that he and Lake had been friends. Labeling Lake a ""complete hypocrite,"" Stevens said he had also performed at Lake's home while children were present.

During her Fox News appearance, Lake said Stevens' allegations were false, and that she was ""appalled"" that Baier mentioned them instead of focusing more on the baseless ""stolen election"" claims that she's championed in her campaign.  

Citing a Washington Post article, Baier brought up the topic of Lake possibly being a fan of drag, which led to Lake turning defensive.""

Lake's team called the director of the Big Data Poll Richard Baris to the witness stand, who claims between 25 and 40,000 voters were disenfranchised on Election Day because of issues at polling locations.

A witness for the defense argued that there is no evidence the printing and tabulator issues caused disenfranchisement.

The hearing is expected to wrap up Thursday afternoon.

The latest ballot results decreased Hobbs lead by 9,750 votes but with more than 98% of the count finished in Maricopa County, Hobbs lead will be too much for Lake to overcome.

Former Fox Darling Kari Lake Implores ‘All’ Fox Hosts to Abandon Their Contracts And ‘Save The Country’ After Carlson Ouster - https://www.mediaite.com/politics/for...

""Former candidate for Governor of Arizona, Kari Lake, is encouraging other hosts on the Fox News network to walk away from their contracts in order to save the country.

The conversation took place on the Thursday edition of Fearless with Jason Whitlock, where Lake reacted to Fox News parting ways with Tucker Carlson.

“Giving our mind and our eyes to something is power for us. If we say we’re not gonna give our mind and eyes to a network because we don’t like the direction they’re going, that’s powerful,” Lake said. “Again, I don’t think they care about the bottom line. They care about the agenda they’re pushing and they’re an establishment Republican group. I’m not trying to be critical of them. That’s just who they are.”""

In a decision Saturday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Peter Thompson, who was appointed by then-Republican Gov.

Hobbs, who is Arizona’s secretary of state, rose to prominence as a staunch defender of the legitimacy of the last election and warned that her Republican rival, former television news anchor Kari Lake, would be an agent of chaos. Hobbs’ victory adds further evidence that Trump is weighing down his allies in a crucial battleground state as the former president gears up for an announcement of a 2024 presidential run.

""Waving flags and religious symbols, the crowd of nearly 100 positioned themselves at the entrance to the Maricopa County Tabulation and Elections Center, which was under heavy security.

Many in the group echoed Trump's unfounded claim that he lost the 2020 election due to voter fraud, as they called for the military to intervene in Arizona's election.

Some also made baseless claims that the Biden government was targeting Trump supporters, with one unidentified man on a megaphone asking the group to pray for people who ""are being tortured in cages in DC right now, who were right here with us two years ago.""

Yikes! Kari Lake Holds Double Digit Lead In Arizona Senate Primary,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhVhMh1JNyA&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BhVhMh1JNyA/maxresdefault.jpg,Farron Balanced,http://www.youtube.com/@FarronBalanced,"A new, hypothetical, poll of Arizona Republicans shows that failed gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake has a massive lead already for next year's Republican senate primary. Lake has a double-digit lead of 28 points over the 2nd place Republican, meaning that right now the nomination is hers to lose. But with the primary a year away and nearly a third of voters undecided, it isn't too far-fetched to think a Republican challenger could knock Lake down. Farron Cousins explains what's happening.

*This transcript was auto-generated. Please excuse any typos.

Even though she is still fighting to become the next governor of Arizona, even though that election is now what, five, six months old, Carrie Lake is still thinking about another office that she wants to run for, even as she again tries to take the office that she rightfully lost a couple months ago. So what's happening right now is Carrie Lake has teased a senate run in Arizona, running for the seat, currently held by Kirsten Sinema, who is now an independent, not a Democrat, but has not officially said she's even running for reelection. And to make matters worse, cuz I talked about Carrie Lake teasing the run last week, a new poll came out on Monday of this week, showing that as it stands right now, Carrie Lake is running away with the Republican nomination in a hypothetical Republican Senate primary in the state of Arizona. Here it is, a poll released by JL Partners and shared with the Hill on Monday, found lake receiving 38% support in an Arizona senate, g o p primary among registered Republican and undeclared voters. Followed next by former Arizona gubernatorial candidate and developer Karen Taylor Robeson at 10%. 

So lakes at 38% in this hypothetical Republican primary second place is at 10. So that is a 28 point gap between Carrie Lake and the person closest to her. That's a horrifying prospect. Like that puts Carrie Lake that much closer to possibly serving as a United States senator, even though not only was she rejected by her voters last year, she has no political experience. Like I think that's the thing that most people keep forgetting. She has no political, like she doesn't know what she's doing. So why, like, why is this now a thing in American politics that we just put up the stupid person who doesn't know what they're doing, they don't have any experience. You know, the, the she's, she doesn't come with from a law background, so it's not even like she understands how the law works the way a lawyer would. I just, I, I don't know. 

I don't know. This is stupid. This is crazy. But this is what we're looking at right now. However, silver linings, right? We gotta look for those. And there is a big silver lining in this particular pole that silver lining is that 29% of those polled said they're undecided. So Carrie Lake has a 28 point lead, which would completely evaporate because you've got 29% who say we don't know who we want right now. So technically, statistically, that race could be technically wide open. Now I know that's a lot of ifs and butts in in that statement, 

But when you have nearly a third of the voters who say, I don't know, then that kind of throws all the results for a loop. Not to mention the fact margin of error is 4.2 percentage points, which as you're taught as I was taught, uh, getting my political science degree, any poll with a margin of error greater than 3% should not be fully trusted. 3% is the standard. Anything above that in the eyes of real, actual political scientists is not exactly trustworthy. Carrie Lake right now, if she is, the actual nominee would lose spectacularly according to the polling data to Democrat Ruben Gallego. But only if Kirsten Sinema doesn't run, if Kirsten Sinema does run, Ruben Gallego still wins, but he only wins by like one or two percentage points, which is within those polls. Margin of error, which means it technically is a statistical tie. 

But only if Kristen Sinema comes in and siphons off enough democratic votes, Sinema has a 0% chance of actually winning. Even if she runs as an independent, she is not going to have that seat after 2024 no matter what. Now she's a wild card, right? She could look at these poles, understand that she has no path forward, not run, and let Ruben Gallego run away with it. Or she could let her ego take over, which honestly is the most likely scenario, run as a spoiler candidate and possibly hand the seat to Kerry Lake. That's what we're looking at in Arizona. It is a very important race.",kariLake,0.4205671300338018

Hobbs and her lawyers, meanwhile, said the suit points to no evidence of Election Day fraud, and fails to point out any actual misconduct.

Arizona Supreme Court rejects most of Kari Lake's election challenge - https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/...

""Arizona's top court has declined to hear Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake's challenge to her election loss, but kept the case alive by sending one of Lake's claims back to a county judge to review.

Lake asked the Arizona Supreme Court to consider her case after a Maricopa County judge and state appeals court rejected her claims that she was the rightful governor, or that a new election should take place.

The former television news anchor made seven legal claims in her case, six of which the state's top court said were properly dismissed by lower courts, according to an opinion released Wednesday written by Chief Justice Robert Brutinel.""

Lying Kari Lake Now Claims Republicans ‘Stole’ Election From Her,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQ3JImc41E&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UcQ3JImc41E/maxresdefault.jpg,The Ring of Fire,http://www.youtube.com/@TheRingofFire,"Sore losing grifter Kari Lake is out with a new, completely unhinged conspiracy: She's claiming that her election was taken away from her by Republicans. Not only is this a blatant lie, but it also makes absolutely no sense. BUT, in a way, her own Party did cost her the election because analyses of the votes found that Republicans simply didn't vote for her even if they voted for other Republicans. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins calls out Lake's lies and explains what actually happened.

Failed Republican gubernatorial candidate. Carrie Lake is out this week with a brand new conspiracy about why she lost the Arizona Governor's race. In a speech this week in San Diego, Carrie Lake told the crowd that it was not, in fact the Democrats who cost her that election, but instead tw the Republicans that done it. Now, if she had ended it there, if she had just said Republicans cost me this election, that would've been an accurate statement. But then she went into conspiracy land, lying to the crowd who for some reason showed up to listen to her, and she said that it wasn't the Republicans who cost her the election. She is saying Republicans stole it from her. Now, I'm gonna read what she said, but I want you to think about that for a minute. A Republican candidate says her Republican party stole it from her. I don't care which way you slice it like that literally makes no sense, and it's a complete lie. It's an absolute fabrication, but it also doesn't make sense. Here's what she said. Now I have to tell you a little bit of bad news about our election. Do you know who stole the election from the people of Arizona? I wish I could stand here and say it was Democrats. It was the Republicans running Maricopa County who stole this election. I hate to have to even say that. It hurts me to say that. 

Now, as I said, if she had just said, Republicans cost me this election, that would be an accurate statement. Because what we have seen from an analysis of the votes in the state of Arizona is that people who voted Republican all the way down the ticket did not vote for Kerry Lake, for governor. I mean, obviously plenty of them did, but tens of thousands of them chose to either leave it blank or to not vote for Carrie Lake as they voted for every other Republican. She was that toxic to them that they said, even though I am a Republican, I will not vote for her. So Republican voters cost you the election because you were too gross of a candidate for them to support. Now, the second thing, she brings up Maricopa County, and I'm glad she did because Maricopa County did do some things, Carrie, that did hurt you, but they didn't hurt your chances of winning. No, no, no, no. They hurt the claims that you're trying to make in court as you lie to judges, because what Maricopa County Republicans did, remembering, of course, what they went through in 2020, they hired more people to go over the ballots. They challenged more signatures than they did in 2020. They hired more people to 

Do signature verification. They put it before more eyeballs. They got rid of more ballots. They made sure that they did everything possible to avoid any of the idiotic and stupid claims from people like Carrie Lake. But Carrie Lake came and made those claims anyway, but it was their extra efforts that have destroyed Carrie Lake's claims in court. So yeah, Maricopa County has cost you a little bit, Carrie, but it's only cost you in court because the Maricopa Republicans are able to prove that you are lying. The voting records, the analyses that have been done on the votes, prove that you are lying and you're still out there lying today. That is what we're dealing with. That is what is happening, and it is beyond disgusting that anybody in any state would show up to hear this lunatic, speak to them.",kariLake,0.3561677429747861

'Fake news shill': Republican Kari Lake slams Australian reporter during leaked interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gog0mdDIGsw&pp=ygUJS2FyaSBMYWtl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gog0mdDIGsw/maxresdefault.jpg,Sky News Australia,http://www.youtube.com/@SkyNewsAustralia,"Kari Lake, a Republican running for governor of Arizona, has savaged the conduct of veteran Australian journalist Liam Bartlett during a fiery video leaked online.

Ms Lake walked out of the interview in protest, accusing the Australian journalist of being biased and a ""joke.""

Mr Bartlett, who works for current affairs program 60 Minutes, conducted the fiery interview via Zoom.

The 25-minute interview started respectfully enough before Mr Bartlett accused the Trump-backed Republican of xenophobia and perpetuating conspiracy theories.",kariLake,0.34726329596728467
