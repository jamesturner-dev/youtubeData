Far-right host Tucker Carlson leaves Fox News in surprise announcement,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19aKtL9pRiE&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/19aKtL9pRiE/maxresdefault.jpg,Guardian News,http://www.youtube.com/@guardiannews,"On Monday, Fox News unexpectedly announced that Tucker Carlson, the network's most popular and controversial presenter, had departed from the channel. 
Subscribe to Guardian News on YouTube ► http://bit.ly/guardianwiressub

The network released a statement indicating that it had mutually agreed with Carlson to part ways. The statement read: 'Fox News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways ... We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor.' 
 
Carlson courted controversy throughout his career relying on provocative and inaccurate reporting to boost his ratings. The Los Angeles Times reported his departure was linked to a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems, which sued the network for defamation after Carlson falsely claimed that the company rigged the 2020 election in favor of Joe Biden.

Tucker Carlson: The core claims about Jan 6 were a lie,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSuolk98UeI&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YSuolk98UeI/maxresdefault.jpg,Redacted,http://www.youtube.com/@RedactedNews,"In our sit-down conversation with Tucker Carlson this weekend, he pointed out inconsistencies with the January 6 footage that he reviewed. His staff was careful not to impugn people without facial recognition software but the footage brought up more questions than answers. Yet the leftist media continues to impugn Tucker personally. Why won't they respond to the inconsistencies and ask to report the story themselves in order to get to the bottom of it? Because they think you're stupid, that's why.

Is A Tucker Carlson And Don Lemon Show In The Works?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DaFn1PV99c&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4DaFn1PV99c/maxresdefault.jpg,Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey,http://www.youtube.com/@IndisputableTYT,"Fox News' Tucker Carlson and CNN's Don Lemon are rumored to be texting with each other after their firings from their respective networks, according to Vanity Fair's Brian Stelter. Dr. Rashad Richey and Rickey Smiley discuss on Indisputable. Tell us what you think in the comments below. 

Read more here: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/...

""Could a blossoming kinship, forged in the fire of unceremonious dismissals on the same day, be developing between Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon? 

Maybe. That’s one of the big takeaways from Brian Stelter, who reports for Vanity Fair that the two men, in addition to retaining the same entertainment lawyer, have reportedly exchanged several texts in the last few days. The content of those messages isn’t yet known, but I have a feeling they hit the same notes as the statements the two men put out since getting canned: stunned, chaotic, and fuming.""

*** 

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we’re taking steps to stop it because we don’t want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it’s the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that’s not coming from us.

We’re told that people who are the ‘Grand Prize Winner’ need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it’s really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

Editor's Note: My edits were all made to keep the video on one, central topic by editing together relevant commentary from many parts of Hasan's streams to create a storyline that is still followable by the viewer. I also edited in commentary of my own in places, in addition to relevant external information that improves the viewing experience. A lot of edits were made for comedy purposes, or to enhance the comedic timing of certain beats, but never to misrepresent Hasan's point of view.

WATCH: Tucker Carlson's Mike Tyson Interview Goes Completely Off The Rails,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGdQ3aJw5gE&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OGdQ3aJw5gE/maxresdefault.jpg,WatchlistTYT,http://www.youtube.com/@WatchlistTYT,"Tucker Carlson interviewed boxing legend Mike Tyson and things got really weird. Jayar Jackson and Adrienne Lawrence break it down on The Watchlist. Watch LIVE on weekdays at noon ET. http://youtube.com/watchlisttyt/live

Read more HERE: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/arti...

""Conservative political pundit and Fox Host Tucker Carlson didn't want to cramp Mike Tyson's style and offered the boxing legend his home to smoke weed before appearing on his show on Wednesday. 

Though Carlson made it clear that it wasn't 'his thing,' a source told Page Six he had no issue with Tyson getting high before appearing on his Fox Nation streaming show Tucker Carlson Today.

Carlson extended the generous offer, particularly since Tyson admitted he would not be able to get through his show without his daily dose of marijuana.

Tyson gladly accepted, and according to some sources, smoked a 'truckload' worth of weed.  

The undisputed world heavyweight boxer owns a cannabis farm in California and said on his podcast that he and co-host Eben Britton smoke about $40,000 of weed a month, The New York Post reported.  

'Tucker told him that it's not his thing personally, but he had no problem with Mike smoking while he was there,' said a source.

Tyson, whose full name is Michael Gerard Tyson, and known as 'Iron Mike' and 'Kid Dynamite,' is considered one of the great heavyweight boxers of all time.""

The Fall of Tucker Carlson at Fox News | Ep 431,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjZ8n4nNTiE&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fjZ8n4nNTiE/maxresdefault.jpg,Jason Whitlock,http://www.youtube.com/@realjasonwhitlock,"A day after the news broke that Fox News was parting ways with Tucker Carlson, Jason collects and shares his thoughts on what contributed to the decision to end cable news' top-rated show. “Tucker Carlson is a white man who used his platform to promote Judeo-Christian culture and the patriarchy. There was a time when his dominant ratings would have protected him from the special-interest groups. Ratings used to be the box hosts were required to check. That time has passed. Message is king.” Former news anchor and Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake joins the show to share an important message for Tucker Carlson. “Fearless” contributors Delano Squires, Shemeka Michelle, and Bryson Gray add their voices to the conversation. And Steve Kim drops in to discuss a parade of sports news, including Aaron Rodgers becoming one of the New York Jets, Jalen Rose calling Phil Jackson a racist, and LSU’s Angel Reese telling Shaq to back off.

Does Christian Nationalism Explain Tucker Carlson’s Demise at Fox News? | Ep 432,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxSglDgLXWM&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZxSglDgLXWM/maxresdefault.jpg,Jason Whitlock,http://www.youtube.com/@realjasonwhitlock,"Vanity Fair was the first publication to provide a new theory for what led to the end of Tucker Carlson’s time at Fox News. In his speech at the Heritage Foundation’s 50th anniversary gala, Tucker verbalized his beliefs that the difference between conservatives and liberals is no longer a policy debate but a battle between “good” and “evil.” Carlson went on to say that offering prayer and petition to God is the only answer for the turmoil in America.  “I have concluded it might be worth taking just 10 minutes out of your busy schedule to say a prayer for the future, and I hope you will…” Allegedly, that was a bridge too far for Rupert Murdoch, and the decision was made to fire Carlson. The man who exposed big pharma and the January 6 tapes went too far when he exhibited the slightest reliance on God. Jason explores the matter through the lens of Christian nationalism. Author of “The Case for Christian Nationalism” Stephen Wolfe joins “Fearless” to discuss his views on the movement. Then, Virgil Walker joins Jason to debate Wolfe’s version of a Christian nation. Plus, Pastor John K. Amanchukwu shares the story behind his viral school board moment and asks the rhetorical question: ""Who’s the pervert?""

""Tucker Carlson insulted comedian Jon Stewart’s appearance Thursday, likening the former Daily Show host to a bug-eating “homeless mental patient” who is also “short.”

According to Carlson, Stewart is so short, he is “too short to date.”

Last week, Stewart made his rounds on cable news to discuss the PACT Act, which at the time was being held up by Republicans in the Senate. Stewart was emotional while speaking in favor of the bill.

On Thursday’s Tucker Carlson Tonight, the host mocked his appearance and demeanor over it. Carlson said""

"Tucker Carlson, Don Lemon OUT In Cable News Shakeup",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ-0UWyPbOg&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rQ-0UWyPbOg/maxresdefault.jpg,Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey,http://www.youtube.com/@IndisputableTYT,"Fox News announced it parted ways with conservative prime time anchor Tucker Carlson the same day CNN's 17-year veteran anchor Don Lemon also claimed via Twitter that he was fired from CNN. Dr. Rashad Richey and David Shuster discuss on Indisputable. Tell us what you think in the comments below. 

Read more here: https://www.nbcnews.com/media/tucker-...

""Fox News said Monday it is parting ways with firebrand anchor Tucker Carlson, the network's most popular prime-time host and a leading voice in the modern conservative movement known for his conspiratorial rhetoric and culture-warrior provocations.

The network announced the stunning news days after it agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avert a high-stakes defamation trial that had cast a shadow over the future of the network.""

*** 

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we’re taking steps to stop it because we don’t want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it’s the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that’s not coming from us.

We’re told that people who are the ‘Grand Prize Winner’ need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it’s really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

""Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it,"" he said in the videotaped statement posted on Twitter that targeted the American media and the U.S. political system.

Carlson did not directly address his sudden departure from Fox, where he hosted the highest-rated cable news program in the key age demographic on the most-watched U.S. cable news network.

His departure from the network came less than a week after parent company Fox Corp settled for $787.5 million in a defamation lawsuit in which Carlson played a starring role.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

It turns out there is precedence for this. In 2003, MSNBC fired Phil Donahue for being the only antiwar voice when other networks were all-in. Carlson had a similar track record of calling out antiwar corruption, Covid corruption, authoritarianism, and more. Who will do that now in TV news?

And one other area Carlson truly stood out is in giving a platform to voices on the left who would criticize the US proxy war against Russia, decry sanctions against Venezuela and call out government lies about chemical attacks in Syria.

Guest host Aaron Maté and Americans’ Comedian Kurt Metzger talk to special guest Jimmy Dore about the comparative dearth of critical voices on issues like Ukraine, Syria and Venezuela in the “liberal” news channels.

Tucker Carlson breaks silence after leaving Fox News | New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xD6vOQ2K7w&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9xD6vOQ2K7w/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,http://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Wednesday night made his first remarks since leaving the network and criticized “people in charge” of Washington, DC.

In a video posted to Twitter, Carlson — who parted ways with Fox News on Monday — accused political leaders on both sides of the aisle of silencing voices and shutting down media outlets that uncover corruption or reveal truths.

“You notice when you take a little time off how unbelievably stupid most of the debates you see on television are. They’re completely irrelevant. They mean nothing. In five years, we won’t even remember that we have them. Trust me as someone who’s participated,” Carlson said.

“Yet at the same time — and this is the amazing thing — the undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all: war, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, natural resources. What was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues?""

Joel Osteen is a Motivational Speaker at Lakewood Church in Houston Texas. The END of Christianity in America Right Before Our Eyes? We are seeing an attack on Christianity and Truth in America more severe than ever before. It is because we have Christian musicians and Christian Teachers that are unwilling to stand for TRUTH. 
Most false teachers never share the whole gospel because it is not nice. Thats why feel good teachers like Andy Stanley, Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Steven Furtick, Joel Osteen, Rick Warren, Beth Moore, TD Jakes, Todd White, Francis Chan,  etc... are so dangerous. 
How to share the Gospel and Apologetics.
Mike Winger, John MacArthur, Voddie Baucham, Paul Washer, Wretched Radio, Todd Friel, TreasureChrist (Reformed Wiki 2.0), Ray Comfort of Living Waters and many other Christians leaders have great videos on Biblical Truth! This is a Christian reaction video where I react to current events.

""Recently dismissed ex-Fox News host Tucker Carlson told a colleague preparing to interview him, “If we’re going to talk about sex, I’d love to hit some of the fine points of technique,” in a new behind-the-scenes video obtained by Media Matters.

The New York Times reported last Wednesday that due to Carlson’s “indiscretion… more evidence of embarrassing and inappropriate conduct could emerge,” highlighting videos obtained by the paper in which Carlson discusses his “postmenopausal fans” and described a woman as “yummy.” Media Matters has also obtained those videos, published below, which paint a picture of Carlson’s behavior on Fox’s set.""*

"Tucker Carlson breaks silence on Fox firing, targets US media and political system",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHW6urQpsRY&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eHW6urQpsRY/maxresdefault.jpg,Global News,http://www.youtube.com/@globalnews,"Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson made his first on-camera appearance Wednesday since his abrupt firing from the network this week, releasing a taped statement in which he criticized the state of political discourse on U.S. television.

In it, he says there has not been a ""legitimate debate"" about issues including war, civil liberties, natural resources or emerging science for a ""long time.""

""Both political parties and their donors have reached consensus on what benefits them and they actively collude to shut down any conversation about it,"" he said.

Carlson, however, did not address his departure from Fox, which came less than a week after parent company Fox Corp settled a $787.5 million defamation lawsuit by Dominion.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us—one that doesn’t just focus on what’s broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it’s increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America—a no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it’s up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That’s it. End of mission.

Joel Osteen is a Motivational Speaker at Lakewood Church in Houston Texas. The END of Christianity in America Right Before Our Eyes? We are seeing an attack on Christianity and Truth in America more severe than ever before. It is because we have Christian musicians and Christian Teachers that are unwilling to stand for TRUTH. 
Most false teachers never share the whole gospel because it is not nice. Thats why feel good teachers like Andy Stanley, Kenneth Copeland, Joyce Meyer, Steven Furtick, Joel Osteen, Rick Warren, Beth Moore, TD Jakes, Todd White, Francis Chan,  etc... are so dangerous. 
How to share the Gospel and Apologetics.
Mike Winger, John MacArthur, Voddie Baucham, Paul Washer, Wretched Radio, Todd Friel, TreasureChrist (Reformed Wiki 2.0), Ray Comfort of Living Waters and many other Christians leaders have great videos on Biblical Truth! This is a Christian reaction video where I react to current events.

""Supporters of Donald Trump are treating the firing of Fox News’s Tucker Carlson about as well as you’d expect.

On Monday, the network shocked the media industry by sending its top-rated host packing less than a week after it agreed to pay $787.5 million in a defamation settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. Fox News is also facing a lawsuit brought by a former producer for Tucker Carlson Tonight, who alleges the company allowed a toxic workplace atmosphere of sexual harassment and general misogyny.""*

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we’re taking steps to stop it because we don’t want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it’s the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that’s not coming from us.

We’re told that people who are the ‘Grand Prize Winner’ need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it’s really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

With Crowder, you know, unable to actually effectively respond to Jon Stewart’s super straightforward arguments about this. Tucker Carlson also is struggling to respond a reminder that they have a bit of a personal history. Jon Stewart's mockery nearly two decades ago of tucker carlson wearing a bow tie on crossfire uh pretty much-caused tucker to abandon his trademark, right? He got so thoroughly embarrassed, but that wasn't all that happened on crossfire. Tucker Carlson was humiliated by Jon Stewart as a hacked to his face in the midst of debates about the Iraq war, and this was part of why I mean Jon Stewart to me was like again there's limitations i think to his politics now, but he's done an amazing job with this issue in particular and why he was such an effective communicator and like a gateway for a lot of people into leftist politics growing up, particularly in the middle of the Iraq war.",tuckerCarlson,0.5809522512910308

Former Fox News producer Abby Grossberg spoke with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace, and told her that Tucker Carlson and his executive producer, Justin Wells, “…were responsible for breaking me and making my life a living hell.”

Grossberg, who is suing Fox News and Tucker, says that there are more recordings from cellphones she turned over to Fox that did not come out in the discovery process of the Dominion lawsuit: “I have several recordings I’m still going through that we recovered from all the phones. There are 90 that we have. I don’t know what Fox turned over.”

The allegations against Carlson and Wells are serious, and they could have a major impact on Fox News. If Grossberg’s lawsuit is successful, it could damage Carlson’s reputation and lead to him being fired from Fox News. It could also damage Fox News’ reputation and lead to a loss of viewers.

Tucker Carlson should come to India and meet his long-lost Indian brother | TV Newsance 210,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFvK-Hq1ebc&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lFvK-Hq1ebc/maxresdefault.jpg,newslaundry,http://www.youtube.com/@newslaundry,"This week, we turn the focus on #GodiMedia’s contemporary in the US, #FoxNews. While Fox settled a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion over its spread of false news, we take a closer look at the similar charades our usual suspects get away with – week in and week out.  

#TuckerCarlson, the channel’s firebrand primetime anchor, who was ousted in the most dramatic exit early in the week bears much resemblance to many of our usual suspects on primetime TV news.
We saw similarities between Tucker and Arnab. But a more suitable match for the former was found. Someone who delivers propaganda, misinformation and conspiracy theories, straight to the viewers, calmly, and without conducting loud debates.

Of course, we are talking about our Jihad expert Sudhir Chaudhary, who, back in India, was at it again. Indeed, Chaudhary made bizarre claims about same sex marriage and depression in India.

In a statement, Fox said that the network and Mr Carlson have agreed to ""part ways"".

His last TV programme was Friday 21 April, the statement added. His primetime slot will now be hosted by a series of interim hosts until a permanent replacement is found.

The brief, two paragraph statement gave no reason for the decision.

The announcement comes just days after Fox News settled a defamation lawsuit from the voting machine company Dominion over its coverage of the 2020 presidential election.

Leaked Footage Shows Tucker Carlson Brutally Attacking His Own Network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3vOBGqGTRM&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/r3vOBGqGTRM/maxresdefault.jpg,The Ring of Fire,http://www.youtube.com/@TheRingofFire,"Footage obtained by Media Matters for America shows Tucker Carlson absolutely trashing his networks own online platform - News Nation - saying that nobody watches it and the website is a complete dumpster fire. The footage isn't necessarily as damning as it is funny, as Carlson was clearly tired of making content for a platform that no one cared about. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins discusses this.

Yesterday, the good folks over at Media Matters, released footage that had been leaked to them of a conversation that Tucker Carlson was having with, uh, what we assumed to be a producer, talking about an interview he was gonna conduct and how angry he was that it was going to have to air on Fox Nation, you know, the Fox News Network streaming platform website, rather than putting it on the main show or even just putting it on YouTube. Tucker Carlson in the clip I'm about to show you repeatedly trashed his own network's platform and on multiple ti uh, occasions there says that nobody's watching it. So here is Tucker Carlson trashing his own network for having a website that doesn't work and that nobody goes to. Anyway, here he is. 

I I don't want to be a slave to Fox Nation, which I don't think that many people watch Anyway. Um, we're gonna, uh, because I I, I, you know, I'm like a representative of the American media now, right? Speaking to an exile in Romania and welcoming him back into the brotherhood of journalists. 

Yeah, it would help us out if you wore a sweater though, because we asked him not to wear a suit like he was panicking about it. So you don't have to Tuck's gonna be looking, uh, casual. That's just how our show looks. Is that okay? 

I I, I mean this is airing on the nighttime show and I wanted to look official. I don't want it to be like bro talk and I, and I, you know what I mean? 

Yeah. But the majority of it, like if we go like 45 minutes, it's gonna be for Fox 

Nation, but nobody's gonna watch it on Fox Nation. Nobody watches Fox Nation because the site sucks. So I'd really like to just put the dump the whole thing on YouTube. Um, but anyway, that's just my view. Um, uh, I'm just frustrated with, uh, in it's hard to use that site. I don't know why they're not fixing it. It's driving me insane. And they're like making like lifetime movies, but they don't, they don't work on the infrastructure of the site. Like what? It's crazy. And it drives me crazy cuz it's like we're doing all this extra work and no one can find it. It's unbelievable. Actually. I don't know who runs that site, but we're 

Gonna play a sizeable trunk on the show tomorrow night. That's the plan. And then what it's gonna do is drive a lot of people to watch this on Fox Nation. It's gonna be a great help to what we're doing over there on season today. 

I know, but I, we we're doing our part, we're like working like animals to produce all this content and the people in charge of it, whoever that guy's, whatever his name is, like they're ignoring the fact that the site doesn't work and it, it's, I think it's like a betrayal of our efforts. That's how I feel. So I, of course I resent it 

For the record. Tucker Carlson is like, do I wear tie? Am I, where am I gonna wear? Am I gonna go a suit? He ended up wearing a sweater for the interview, so, you know, he did go a little more cash, just had the sweater on, keeping it cool for Fox Nation. Now the guest he's talking about was Andrew Tate, and this was from August of 2022. And then in December of 2022, right after he had tried to mock Greta Thunberg on, uh, Twitter, Tate was arrested. Uh, here it is, he's being investigated on allegations of rape people trafficking and forming an organized crime group. Um, so he is, he is being held on house arrests and he's still facing those investigations and those potential charges. He has not been put on trial or convicted, but that is the man that Tucker Carlson",tuckerCarlson,0.5496914771364968

"Why Did Fox Fire Tucker Carlson? Far-Right Host Helped Fox Mainstream Hate, Conspiracies to Millions",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBRDR2bVwl4&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qBRDR2bVwl4/maxresdefault.jpg,Democracy Now!,http://www.youtube.com/@DemocracyNow,"In a surprise announcement, Fox News said Monday it was cutting ties with its top-rated host Tucker Carlson, effective immediately. Although a precise reason wasn't given, the move came just days after the cable network settled a $787.5 million defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over lies propagated by the cable network about the 2020 presidential election. Since taking over the primetime slot in 2016, Carlson has also spread far-right talking points about immigrants, Black people and the LGBTQ community. For more, we speak with Madeline Peltz of Media Matters for America, where she has helped to expose Carlson's extremism. ""It creates a major vacuum in the right-wing media ecosystem,"" Peltz says of Carlson's departure.

Newsmax Is Begging Tucker Carlson To Come Save Their Network,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VslglLMritQ&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VslglLMritQ/maxresdefault.jpg,Farron Balanced,http://www.youtube.com/@FarronBalanced,"According to a report by TMZ, conservative media outlet Newsmax is begging Tucker Carlson to come and save their network. And they aren't just offering him his own show - the report says that they are willing to basically give Carlson complete control of the network. This is further proof that the network has absolutely no standards at all, and they will sacrifice credibility for ratings any day of the week. Farron Cousins explains what's happening.

*This transcript was auto-generated. Please excuse any typos.

According to a new report from TMZ out late last week, newsmax, the Conservative outlet that was recently pulled, then re-added to the dying Direct TV lineup, is begging Tucker Carlson to please come and save our network. Now, they're not using the phrase Save Our Network because Newsmax refuses to believe that they're in any kind of trouble. But TMZ says they are begging Tucker Carlson to come and join them, and not just as a host. Of course, he would get his own show, but TMZ is reporting that Newsmax is offer also offering him complete control of the network's programming. Now, if that doesn't scream, save us from ourselves, then I don't know what does. And of course, it's not unlike Newsmax to take Fox's Castaways and put them on the air. They did it with Eric Bowling, who was unceremoniously, of course, removed from Fox News many years ago, and he landed a nice little gig at Newsmax because that's just where all the Fox News rejects go. 

But Newsmax may wanna think twice about offering Tucker Carlson the world to come and save their network. Because it was also reported on Friday that the higher ups at Fox News who have seen these disgusting text messages that were redacted, that eventually both led to his firing and the settlement with Dominion because they were so bad. Fox didn't want them to get out to the public. Newsmax doesn't care. But reports on Friday said that the higher ups at Fox News believed that these text messages from Tucker Carlson were so bad, so disgusting that the network would not have been able to recover from it. Like not just that, oh no, these text messages will make us lose this lawsuit or maybe lose a different lawsuit. They thought that what Tucker Carlson said that, as I said, we don't know what it is yet, but what he said was so bad, Fox News would've been destroyed. 

Newsmax has seen those same reports. Maybe they choose not to believe them, but they know that they're out there. They know that the text messages were bad enough for the network to be like, we're gonna get rid of our highest rated, the highest rated host in all of cable news. We're gonna can him because of what he said. And Newsmax is out there. Say like, we'll take him. We'll give you complete control of our network. You disgusting, horrid human being, whatever it takes to get a couple more dollars in our pockets, right? Newsmax, do you really, this is a rhetorical question that we already know the answer to, but do you really have such low standards, both morally, ethically, 

Business wise, that you're willing to take on such a liability that even Fox News was like, dude, this is too much for us. Are you willing to sync that loan news Max? Yes, of course you are because you want the ratings, right? You want that sweet, sweet money ignoring, of course, the fact that 26 major advertisers had already pulled all their ads from Tucker Carlson's program. Typically, the ads run during Tucker Carlson's show were either for MyPillow, even though the guy claims he hates Fox, he's still advertising there. Or they were promos for other Fox News shows. Yes, they were paying Tucker a pretty penny because they were hoping that the audience would either tune in early so they could get a couple ads in there or stay after so they could get some ads in there. But the major advertisers weren't running stuff on Tucker's show, so he basically became more of an expense than a profit generating machine. But Newsmax, if you want to take that hit, if you wanna show the entire country that you have absolutely no scruples whatsoever, that you will literally do anything for ratings and or a dollar, then by all means, continue pursuing Tucker Carlson.",tuckerCarlson,0.4801411923219506

Tucker Carlson Posts WEAK Response To Getting Fired By Fox News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9e9g7NKs4E&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y9e9g7NKs4E/maxresdefault.jpg,The Majority Report w/ Sam Seder,http://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport,"Tucker Carlson, the former host of Fox News's ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" has posted a cryptic social media message in response to his firing from the network.

In the message, Carlson speaks broadly about the lack of debate on television and the state of the news media. He does not directly address his firing, but he does say that he is ""grateful for the opportunity"" he had at Fox News.

Carlson's firing comes after the network settled a $787.5 million defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit alleged that Carlson and Fox News had defamed Dominion by spreading false claims about the company's role in the 2020 election.

Tucker Carlson Tonight used to be one of the most watched on the entire Fox network. Its host, Tucker Carlson, grew up with a media-minded father. He originally tried to join the CIA but, when his application got rejected, went into journalism instead. In a few decades, he became a mainstay of news media. He was never free from the controversy that the position comes with. Not everyone agreed with his views on issues such as women, immigration, and President Donald Trump.

Fox kept their controversial cash cow around until they got into a bit of trouble of their own. They were sued by Dominion Voting Systems for defamation. The network’s programs alleged that the company’s technology was used to rig the 2020 election in favor of Joe Biden. Tucker Carlson Tonight was one of them. The case was settled out of court to the tune of $787.5 million. It wasn’t as much as Dominion wanted, but it sent a message and kept Fox’s secrets safe. The network fired Tucker soon after news of the settlement became public. It was sudden, shocking his colleagues and even President Trump himself.

The reason for his departure isn’t clear. It could have been his role in the defamation lawsuit, his other suit from Abby Grosberg, his controversial comments about upper management, or a combination of all of the above. Fans will miss Tucker’s nightly broadcasts, but losing him isn’t the worst part. The real damage, as he insinuated early, is the loss of trust. Americans are more convinced than ever that they can’t trust their news media to tell them the truth.

MSM Warns It’s ‘DANGEROUS’ To Discuss RFK Jr's 2024 Run As He Sits For Tucker Carlson Interview,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqAywexVWdE&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OqAywexVWdE/hqdefault.jpg,The Hill,http://www.youtube.com/@thehill,"""Briahna Joy Gray and Robby Soave react to Robert F. Kennedy Jr's interview with Tucker Carlson. #rfk #2024 #biden Disclaimer: According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age.

Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.

While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.

The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.

In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.

Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either 6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series, or 2 months after their initial Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. People ages 16–17 may get a booster dose of Pfizer at least 6 months after their initial series of vaccines.

The CDC says A person is fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all recommended doses in the primary series of their COVID-19 vaccination. A person is up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received all recommended doses in the primary series and one booster when eligible.

Getting a second booster is not necessary to be considered up to date at this time. A study by The Cleveland Clinic found that both previous infection and vaccination provide substantial protection against COVID-19. Vaccination of previously infected individuals does not provide additional protection against COVID-19 for several months, but after that provides significant protection at least against symptomatic COVID-19.""",tuckerCarlson,0.4219207482978262

Separately, a former producer for Tucker Carlson Tonight is suing Fox, alleging sexual harassment.

Fox News Honchos Allegedly Have An ‘Oppo File’ Of Dirt On Tucker Carlson Should He Try Anything Retaliatory - https://uproxx.com/viral/fox-news-opp...

""When word broke that Tucker Carlson was leaving Fox News, the network made it sound like they were amicably parting ways. According to subsequent reports, that’s not so. For one thing, the Putin-loving host was allegedly fired. For another, he apparently had no idea what was coming and was as surprised as everyone else. This all may get incredibly messy — or maybe not, seeing that Fox News may have enough dirt to keep him in line.

As per Rolling Stone, multiple sources claim the conservative network’s communications department — run by the notoriously aggressive Irena Briganti — have what one called an “oppo file” on Tucker. Within it lie “complaints regarding workplace conduct, disparaging comments about management and colleagues, and allegations that the now-former primetime host created a toxic work environment, three of the sources say.”

Tucker Carlson released a video on Wednesday addressing his firing from Fox News several days prior.

During the video, which was published to Carlson’s Twitter account, the former Fox News host said he realized after stepping “outside the noise for a few days” how “unbelievably stupid most of the debates you see on television are,” arguing that they were “completely irrelevant” and “mean nothing.”

He goes on to say that while it is a good thing that Tucker is gone, this doesn’t change the fact that Fox News is an incredible danger to America and whoever fills Carlson’s slot, will continue to lie to the American people.

Marjorie Taylor Greene Says Fox News ‘Caved to the Woke Mob’ by Firing Tucker Carlson: ‘End of the First Amendment’ - https://www.mediaite.com/tv/marjorie-...

""Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) blasted Fox News, saying the network “caved to the woke mob” by firing Tucker Carlson on Monday.

Appearing on Wednesday’s edition of The Balance on Newsmax, Greene – an occasional guest on Fox News – claimed Fox has lost its conservative way.

“I think it was devastating to our First Amendment,” she said about the decision by a private company to part ways with an employee. “Our First Amendment is free speech, but it’s also freedom of press.”""

Fox host Tucker Carlson admitting he hates Donald Trump “passionately,” and conceding that Fox anchors have been “pretending” to believe Trump’s election lies that they pushed anyway.

There have been 180 mass shootings this year so far. We are in the middle of one of the deadliest years as Republican lawmakers fight to make access to guns easier. We will speak with the National African American Gun Association President about what policy can be passed to combat mass shootings in America.

Tucker Carlson is back in the headlines this time as newly revealed text messages are unredacted, showing Carlson's blatantly racist and appealing text that was even too extreme for Fox News. We will show you the text messages that got Carlson kicked out of Fox News.

South Carolina is embroiled in a battle to hold people accountable for hate crimes as one of the only states in the nation that don't have hate crime laws on the books. For the past three years, a hate crimes bill has made it through the South Carolina House and to the Senate floor, only to stop there. We will be speaking about what Democrats are doing to try to get the Clementa C. Pinckney Hate Crimes Act passed.

In our continuing coverage of honoring the life and legacy of Harry Belafonte, we have Atlanta Ambassador Andrew Young joining us to discuss how he remembers the late icon.

According to a massive new report from Rolling Stone, Fox News actually kept an oppo file, like opposition research file on Tucker Carlson in case the day comes where he ever turned against the network. And now that he's been fired from the network, they're increasingly concerned that he will eventually start lashing out at them, which of course is why we've got the file of all of the horrible things you've done since you've been at the network. Now, according to Rolling Stone, uh, this Carlson dossier, uh, was led by the notoriously aggressive arena Briganti, who heads the networks communications department. So you had your own communications department. Basically keep an eye on your most popular host. Every horrible thing they said, every allegation against him, you put it in a file. Now, from what I'm reading here, the file contains allegations. Carlson created a toxic work environment and includes claims that he made disparaging comments about management and colleagues, as well as complaints about his workplace conduct, which includes creating a culture of sexual harassment, maybe not engaging in it himself, but according to a lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg, the former Carlson producer, his staff sure as hell dead. 

Now, you're probably thinking the same thing I'm thinking right now, like, why are you just keeping this in an oppo research file, uh, file instead of using it to fire him long time ago? Right? Because it kind of seems like all of this stuff is fireable offenses. All of this stuff are things that will get you sued, and we know that because you're now being sued for them. So why didn't you just get rid of the problem a long time ago instead of saying, Ooh, sexual harassment, now we gotcha when we need to turn against you. 

Here's a problem, Fox. You have this material. Now, the network, of course, has come out and said, Nope, this is ridiculous. We do not have an opposition research file. We wish Tucker well. Rolling Stone confirmed this story with eight different sources. Eight, eight people with insider knowledge said, oh no, this is real. They do this. What this means is that Fox News just opened themselves up to a brand new avenue of liability, because if you knew these things were happening and then you did nothing, but you just wanted to hold it so that you could, you know, make him look bad someday if he turned against you, otherwise you weren't gonna use it, but you knew about it, you just lost your lawsuit 

That Abby Grossberg filed against you. That's what just happened. That's what this story is. This isn't about Tucker Carlson. This is about Fox News. Knowing about the culture that he created at the network, and not doing anything about it, but using it as a threat to say, if you come against us, we're gonna go after you. You are screwed Fox News. You better hope that those eight sources were lying and that this stuff doesn't actually exist. Because if it does, you're never gonna win another lawsuit again for the rest of time.",tuckerCarlson,0.3369363296234122

Tucker Carlson sent a racist text to a producer: 'It's not how white men fight',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ztFULmmnOY&pp=ygUOVHVja2VyIENhcmxzb24%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1ztFULmmnOY/maxresdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCIAKENAF8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-CYAC0AWKAgwIABABGFcgXyhlMA8=&rs=AOn4CLASO3xZvMQ0W-kp9HBX3ze-18yCVA,WRAL,http://www.youtube.com/@WRAL5,"CNN — In a newly revealed text message, ousted Fox News host Tucker Carlson made a racist comment and said he found himself briefly rooting for a mob of Trump supporters to kill a person.
""A couple of weeks ago, I was watching video of people fighting on the street in Washington,"" Carlson texted a producer. ""A group of Trump guys surrounded an Antifa kid and started pounding the living s**t out of him. It was three against one, at least. Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously. It's not how white men fight. Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they'd hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it."" The text was one of a trove of messages from Carlson and other Fox News hosts uncovered in a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems against the network for airing false allegations that the company's machines were used to steal the 2020 election from former President Donald Trump.

The sides settled just as the trial was getting underway, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion nearly $800 million.

While some of Carlson's texts have been publicly released, the one quoted by the Times remains redacted by the court, as do numerous other exhibits. Media organizations, including The Associated Press, continue to try to lift the redactions.

The Times reports that Carlson sent the text to a producer hours after Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He describes a video he had seen a couple of weeks earlier of Trump supporters beating someone he described as “an Antifa kid.”

Carlson wrote about his conflicting emotions in watching the fight, which he described as “three against one, at least.”

“Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously,” he wrote, according to the Times. “It’s not how white men fight.”

“I should remember that somewhere somebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed,” Carlson wrote, after admitting part of him was rooting for the attackers. “If I don’t care about those things, if I reduce people to their politics, how am I better than he is?”

Before his ouster last month, Carlson was Fox's top-rated host. He drew controversy for supporting theories such as the idea that immigrants are being admitted to the U.S to “replace” people born here. Critics have called that white supremacy, an accusation he has denied.

Messages sent Wednesday to Carlson and his attorney seeking comment were not immediately returned.

The text messages were from Tucker Carlson, and they contained horrific slurs, disgusting imagery, and offensive remarks. Knowing that these texts would soon become public, Fox rushed to settle the lawsuit and then fired Carlson. The picture is now nearly crystal clear as to what happened, as Farron Cousins explains.

*This transcript was auto-generated. Please excuse any typos.

It now appears like we have a firm reason why Tucker Carlson was fired from Fox News earlier this week, but it's more than just that. We also now have a very clear reason as to why Fox News. Suddenly, right as the Dominion Defamation Trial began, decided to work out a settlement with the company. And it all comes down to what Tucker did. According to a massive new report from the New York Times, there were more Tucker Carlson text messages that were a part of the Dominion lawsuit that the public didn't get to see. Now, I don't always like saying I told you so, but that is 100% what I sat right here and told y'all was going to happen. I told y'all that the text messages we had already seen as bad as they were, were just the tip of the iceberg because those were only revealed because Dominion had to reveal them in their court filings to fight back other motions filed by Fox News. And that the real juicy stuff. And honestly, I think I said this like two weeks ago, the real juicy stuff wasn't gonna come out until the trial. 

Turns out I was a hundred percent right, but we, the public weren't the only people who were expecting horrible text messages to come out because apparently in the redacted court filings that the Fox News Board of directors and other executives only received the night before the trial began. They got to see these horrific text messages that unfortunately we still don't know the contents of, but they were from Tucker Carlson. Several of them had him referring to women by the C word. Um, others were, you know, very graphic, very disturbing, very disparaging, you know, possibly a little bit of bigotry tossed in there we're not a hundred percent certain, but the text messages were so bad. The content in them was so obscene according to the people that have seen them, that it would've cost the network bid ti big time. Like they were so afraid of these text messages becoming public, that they paid Dominion voting systems, 787 million, just so the public wouldn't see these text messages. That's how bad they were. 787 million. To not show you what Tucker Carlson was saying in private, that is a hefty price tag. And that, of course, according to this report and according to the analysis, is what not only led to the settlement, but then eventually led to his firing a week later, earlier this week. So how bad are those text messages? We don't know, but apparently bad enough 

To be willing to write a check for 787 million. Now here's the thing. Fox's own lawyers had these text messages, right? They knew about 'em, but they didn't tell their own clients until the night before. Like they're getting ready to go to bed. Like, all right guys, sleep tight. We got a big trial tomorrow. Oh, by the way, have you seen these texts from Tucker Carlson? Woo, boy, they're bad. Well, anyway, goodnight fire those lawyers immediately, like fi, they should have been fired before you fire Tucker Carlson, because that is absolutely horrific. Your own lawyers were apparently not being forthright with you and giving you all of the information that they had information that could have caused you to negotiate a settlement months ago. Of course, if you had negotiated a settlement months ago, then the lawyers wouldn't have been able to still keep working on the Dominion case, so they wouldn't have gotten paid. 

So you got screwed at least twice. But those lawyers ought to be fired. I mean, honest to God, these lawyers at this point, I believe, need to be investigated because you withheld evidence from your own client so that you could continue the case so you would continue to get paid. That's, that's absolutely legal malpractice in my opinion. A and you ought to be investigated, potentially disbarred for doing that to them. Not that they didn't deserve it, but just because somebody deserves something doesn't mean it's always legal, right? We all agree on that, but it is what it is.",tuckerCarlson,0.31594351658240344
