""Saturday Night Live"" introduced its first ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù cast member during the ""Weekend Update"" sketch with co-hosts Michael Che and Colin Jost. A shocking report, titled ‚ÄúThe 8 March Principles for a Human Rights-Based Approach to Criminal Law Proscribing Conduct Associated with Sex, Reproduction, Drug Use, HIV, Homelessness and Poverty,‚Äù issued by international legal experts with the backing of the United Nations appears to open the floodgates to normalize sex with minors. The House Judiciary Committee, led by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), met in Manhattan today. The hearing, concerning the victims of violent crime, examined how Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg‚Äôs pro-crime, anti-victim policies have led to an increase in violent crime and a dangerous community for New York City residents. The violent rampage of over 100 teenagers wreaked havoc on downtown Chicago Saturday night, leaving two teenage boys shot and lots of damage to cars and buildings.

10 Famous Budweiser Super Bowl Commercials,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLQwfC966iw&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vLQwfC966iw/maxresdefault.jpg,Dalibor Truhlar,https://www.youtube.com/@DaliborTruhlar,"Budweiser Super Bowl ads are iconic, so I decided to include some of them in a video, especially the ones I think are the most famous. Many of them didn‚Äôt make it into my selection and the decision wasn't easy for me. However, the hardest part was finding them in a decent quality in the first place. It's as if the responsible ones didn't even bother to keep these gems available. Congratulations to Anheuser Busch, the advertising agencies, and all the people who created these jewels. I hope you enjoy them.

These ads are included:

1. Budweiser, ‚ÄúLost Dog‚Äù from the 2015 Super Bowl with Don Jeanes, the famous Clydesdales and a cute puppy ‚Äì this is actually a follow up to ‚ÄúPuppy Love‚Äù from the 2014 Super Bowl which is the follow up to ""Brotherhood"" from the 2013 Super Bowl

4. Budweiser, ‚ÄúDonkey‚Äù res. ""Born a Donkey"" from the 2004 Super Bowl

In 2011 there has been another version with the One World Trade Center in it and in 2021 another updated version. I‚Äôm using the original version that was shown during the Big Game.

+

11. Budweiser, ‚ÄúWhassup‚Äù from 1999, a commercial that has written history and actually never aired during a Super Bowl ‚Äì it came out in December 1999 and became immediately a hit, but at the 2000 Super Bowl ""Whassup Girlfriend"" resp.

11.5 Budweiser, ""What Are You Doing"" from the 2001 Super Bowl ‚Äì this one is less well known than the previous one but was an actual Super Bowl commercial and has a lot of fans for a very good reason.

The series of people includes Ali Krieger & Ashlyn Harris, World Cup champions and members of the U.S. women‚Äôs national soccer team who recently married each other. The two appear after full championship team appears near the end of the ad.

You can watch the teaser here: ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†Budweiser¬†-¬†Super...¬†¬†

Just six years after the first LGBT representation in the biggest advertising event of the year, this is one of at least 5 commercials featuring LGBT characters. We have come a long way, helped no doubt by the SCOTUS decision to allow same-sex marriage in 2015.

Due to the isolated location it appears there are two beer distributors in Kingman‚Ä¶ Romer Beverage and Canyon Distributing.  Being a truck driver I‚Äôm very familiar with much of the logistics industry and most distributor trucks even a sales or merchandising truck would have the company name.  Best I can tell this truck had no company name on it but that does not mean it is not from one of these distributors. I‚Äôm going to call both of them and let them know about the video so they can hopefully have a talk with their POS employee since they ran from me when I called them back to teach them some respect.  Feel free to contact Anheuser-Busch corporate customer service and ask them why their distributor employees hate truck drivers?? If this was not a distributor truck the only other possibility that seems closable is that it was a sweepstakes truck years ago and that‚Äôs why it has the Budweiser logos but the chances of that seem pretty slim.",budweiser,0.7164173743665511

Beer brewing in Budweis dates back to the 13th century. A few hundred years later, two breweries were founded in the city that made beer which they called ""Budweiser,"" both being beers from the city of Budweis, which was then a part of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1876, the American brewer Anheuser-Busch began making a beer which it also called ""Budweiser"". This led in 1907 to the ""Budweiser trademark dispute"" between beer companies claiming trademark rights to the name ""Budweiser"".",budweiser,0.6609404856781488

What I love about this ad is the absolute chutzpah of the idea. Just imagine how this ad would have looked like on a storyboard being presented to a client. Frankly, it's a miracle that it was sold.

But it's great. It's beautifully produced and perfectly paced. The 'lizards' campaign that followed it is even better. 

You can find that here:  ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†Budweiser:¬†LIZARD...¬†¬†  

But that campaign never would have happened without this great ad featuring three frogs in a swamp.

It is on our list of the greatest Super Bowl ads of all time.

Let me ask you then 

Are you?

Put me in a room with a bunch of tycoons ima walk out a made man (what you gonna do?) We can book a show on the moon but my band ain‚Äôt playing no EDM (that ain‚Äôt the move) I‚Äôm in the sunshine state but they‚Äôll do you the shadiest
Young, black, gifted, and dangerous
Don‚Äôt play with us (somebody better tell ‚Äòem look out ‚Äòcause right now)
I can‚Äôt lose (right now)
I can‚Äôt lose (right now)
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm always gonna play to win (If Imma play, Imma play to win) I can‚Äôt lose (right now)
I can‚Äôt lose (right now)
I can‚Äôt lose (right now)
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm always gonna play to win
Are you good enough to make this shot?
Think you big enough to fill up the slot 
Are you really getting back on your feet? 
Tell me this Is this is it art, is it niche? 
Are you?
Should you?
Will you? 
Can you‚Äì
Another pass

On the west side black mammas and gorillas
You can hear the war cries every night up in the village Came up out a small town so I had to do it bigger When you walk a fine line, superhero or a villain
When you talk opinions , everybody got a million of ‚Äòem (I got a million of ‚Äòem) Okay you talking but we live it

The Fall of Budweiser -- No Longer America's Favorite Beer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAaJkqMxPzc&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gAaJkqMxPzc/maxresdefault.jpg,Beer By The Numbers,https://www.youtube.com/@BeerByTheNumbers,"The Fall of Budweiser -- No Longer America's Favorite Beer

On this episode of Beer By The Numbers we take a look at Budweiser's slow fall from grace. 30 years ago Budweiser dominated the Beer world here in the US. Now it only holds the #3 spot and it's still slipping fast. Today we try to get to the bottom of the trends behind this decline. Cheers!

Lil Baby - Everybody Wants to Rule the World lyrics
[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
I‚Äôm by far one of the hardest workers
Real firm believer in ‚Äúpractice make perfect‚Äù
You can gather all the water,
Stay thirsty
Took a lot to get us here
We broke curses
Kill or be killed
The field show no mercy
Losers just lose
While winners get worshipped
I came here for fun, let‚Äôs get turnt up
Somebody pass me a Budweiser
A cold one
I wanna rule the world, I can‚Äôt hold you
Hell of a life I feel like I‚Äôm chosen
Head on tight I feel like I‚Äôm focused
I ain‚Äôt ever satisfied
I want more
Covid came and held us up
We back rolling
Look at all the people in here
We got motion
Everybody back outside
That‚Äôs sum to toast to
Whole bunch of real good vibes
It feel so cool
I think its about that time
It‚Äôs getting closer
Whole lotta fingers crossed
A lotta hoping
Wishing for the best
Preparing for the worst too
Got out here and bust my ass
I had to work too
Some stuff is outta my hand 
I can‚Äôt control it
If I don‚Äôt know nothing dawg I know one thing 
 
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
 
Everybody Wants to Rule the World
 
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I think I left all my feelings at home
It‚Äôs okay, won‚Äôt be using them anyway
I‚Äôm determined to win
Each and every way
Give thanks to the most highest,
Each and every day
Even when it‚Äôs a sport I ain‚Äôt come to play
I be serious, that‚Äôs what works for me
same swang everyday I can‚Äôt switch routine
Tryna go see some places I never seen
I done said a whole lot, never said it‚Äôs easy
Tryna climb to the top,
I‚Äôm just steady creeping
Could be better a lot
But I‚Äôm more than decent
Kind of feel like a dream,
But I‚Äôm wide awake
They don‚Äôt give you the title
You gotta take it
Lots of energy mixed with determination
I‚Äôm a go-er
I don‚Äôt like procrastination
Im just growing
I feel like I need my space 
When you really the truth you don‚Äôt gotta fake it
I‚Äôm so close to the finish line I gotta make it
Gotta go when it‚Äôs crunch
I can‚Äôt hesitate 
Handle business on time I ain‚Äôt ever late
Im wit y‚Äôall but I come from another place
One thing we got in common is that 
 
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Everybody Wants to Rule the World

Many people have criticized Bud Light for working with Mulvaney despite his history, arguing that it sends a message that such behavior is acceptable or excusable. Some people have even called for a boycott of Bud Light products as a result of the partnership.

Bud Light has since issued a statement in response to the backlash, stating that they ""do not condone derogatory language or behavior of any kind"" and that ""we understand the concerns raised about a recent influencer partnership and we apologize for any offense that it may have caused."" Despite this apology, it remains to be seen how the public will respond and whether the controversy will have a lasting impact on Bud Light's reputation. We discuss the ongoing backlash!

Yet, their communications have not always been subtle, or supportive.

In this classic commercial from 1993, four men in drag play out their game of make believe - in ""Ladies' Night"". 

AdRespect: ""The ad isn't meant to parody transgendered persons or gays, it plays on the Ms. Doubtfire/Tootsie joke of obvious men dressing as women out of need - it's older than television. The campaign has been so successful it has run for many years and has carried variations that included Don Rickles mistakenly picking up one of the women. One variation that was shot but never aired included a Los Angeles drag queen.""

‚ÄúBacklash, boycotts, support for beer company Bud Light after they launched a new ad campaign featuring transgender activist and influencer Dylan Mulvaney,‚Äù Lemon explained.

After playing a social media video of Mulvaney touting Bud Light cans with the influencer‚Äôs face on them, Lemon derided critics: ‚ÄúSo the buzzword ‚Äòwoke‚Äô was once again brought into the mix, with people posting videos of them dumping out beer, calling for a boycott.‚Äù 

However, he noted, ‚ÄúDespite all of this, an expert tells CNN that once the social media backlash blows over, the long-term benefits of the company taking a cultural stand like this may be more impactful.‚Äù

Turning to CNN business and politics correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich, Lemon remarked, ‚ÄúLook, I think it‚Äôs crazy, but I want you to walk this ‚Äî walk us through this.‚Äù

Then, Bob Vander Plaats of the Family Leader joins the show to react to a new attack ad from a DeSantis-aligned PAC. In Hour Two, Steve reads feedback he's received from people who saw ""Nefarious"" this weekend.

Why Budweiser Is No Longer The King Of Beer,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1ATjEgjcnA&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q1ATjEgjcnA/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC,https://www.youtube.com/@CNBC,"Anheuser-Busch InBev is the world's largest brewer with 500 brands in more than 100 countries. In 2016, Flemish Interbrew and Brazilian Ambev, together known as InBev, merged with the American legacy company Anheuser-Busch, which ultimately brought AB under the leadership of 3G Capital. 3G Capital is a Brazilian-American global investment firm whose tactics include an aggressive, and at times controversial, cost-cutting strategy. AB InBev's longtime priority of aggressive acquisitions has been coupled with a focus on profit and price per barrel rather than volume share. Premiumization and expanding beyond beer continue to be winning strategies. In 2021, the company amassed $54.3 billion in revenue with 169,000 employees worldwide. As overall beer consumption has declined, AB InBev has transformed from merely a beer company to the largest beverage company in the world.

The BetaGems channel also has ""1984 Karla DeVito sings for Budweiser commercial,"" ""Budweiser Blues 1987 musical TV commercial,"" ""Hip-hop farmers 1993 Budweiser TV ad,"" and ""Bud Light 1986 TV ad Todd Susman & Kevin Farley.""

BetaGems are culled from an archive of over 1000 beta video tapes recorded from the early 1980s into the 1990s. Most feature live music performances broadcast on television in San Diego CA, though there are also rarely seen commercials, comedy clips, and other material that doesn't seem to be anywhere else on Youtube or online. 

Most of the tapes were recorded on a Sony SL-HFT7 Super Beta Theater Hi-Fi Stereo - the same model was refurbished and is being used for these digital transfers and uploads. In rare occasions where a BetaGems clip does appear elsewhere, we're only uploading if our own beta master is better quality or contains material not seen previously. Much footage comes from public television and public access broadcasts that the taper, who worked for a local cable TV production company in the 1980s, monitored nightly for several years. Some of the programming is strictly regional, mostly from the San Diego area.",budweiser,0.6193956116156263

Republicans are still freaking out over the Dylan Mulvaney promotion of Bud Light. And if you're not familiar, of course, bud Light recently, uh, used a transgender influencer to do a promotion for the company, like literally one video. So Republicans have spent the last two weeks freaking out claiming Bud Light has gone woke, and their little boycott of the company has now met some pretty ferocious backlash from within their own party. Donald Trump Jr. Has now put out a video begging conservatives to please back off of Bud Light and Anheuser-Busch, they don't deserve this, right? It's over with. Let it go, stop being freaks basically is what Junior says. And believe it or not, Junior's, right? But over the weekend, the N R C C, the National Republican Campaign creeps whatever the N R C C stands for. I forget at the moment. Um, they put out a tweet that said, thanks to Dylan Mulvaney, we can finally admit that Bud Light tastes like water with our new coozies. You can make sure no one confuses Bud Light with real beer ever again. 

And then a little while later, the NCC deleted that tweet because apparently they were reminded shortly after they sent it that, Hey, Anheuser Anheuser-Busch gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party every single campaign cycle, and you're screwing us. So the NCC thought, oh, I I like money, I gotta delete the tweet. And I'm sure that had a lot to do with Don Jr coming out saying like, guys, x nay on the UD Light Bay. Right? Because we want that Anheuser Bush money because Republicans love a good woke freak out for their Republican base. But what they don't like is actually getting any backlash from it from corporations. Hell, even Disney that has been in Ron DeSantis has crosshairs for well over a year and royally screwed him over because they're much smarter. They still gave money to his reelection and his inauguration for the second, uh, term. 

Like they didn't even hold him accountable or punish him in any way. And Bud Lights over here saying, guys, listen, not Bud Light, but Anheuser-Busch, uh, you know how much money we give you, right? I mean, you can see the numbers. It's publicly available online for anyone too. You're gonna us off and you're not gonna get any more of that. We are one of the top Republican donors in the country, and you're us off. Does that, does that sound like a smart thing to do? No. No. Probably not. But here's the thing. Republicans, it's, it's beer. Okay? It's a beer. If you want to drink it, drink it. Drinking it is not going to turn you 

Transgender, okay? It's not going to make gay people straight or straight people gay. It's not gonna do any of that. It's a beer. It, it's going to increase your blood alcohol content level if that is what you're looking for, okay? If you wanna drink it, drink it. If you don't, don't. But don't get up on your idiotic high horse and act like we're superior because we're boycotting this because we're afraid of a transgender influencer, which is what you're admitting to. You're afraid of Dylan Mulvaney. It's hilarious. It's absolutely ridiculous that Republicans will find anything to freak out about. It's not like Dylan Mulvaney is going out there and doing commercial after commercial after commercial for Bud Light.",budweiser,0.5847476498862629

If enacted into law, transgender girls would be prohibited from participating in sports that correspond with their gender identity under a bill that advanced Tuesday in the North Carolina Senate.

The Senate education committee advanced the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act"" on a voice vote with Republicans on the panel saying such a blanket ban is necessary to protect biological girls and saying that the small number of transgender girls, estimated at 15, currently participating in North Carolina is too many.

""Kid Rock has been left so furious with Bud Light's new choice of influencer that he took out several cases with an automatic gun.

The pro-Trump singer, wearing a MAGA hat, said he wanted to send a 'clear and concise' message after discovering trans content creator Dylan Mulvaney was working with the beer company.

Mulvaney, 26, announced the partnership in a series of videos posted to social media at the weekend to coincide with the NCAA March Madness tournament.""

The Bud Light Situation Just Keeps Getting WORSE,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY61FAABWso&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fY61FAABWso/maxresdefault.jpg,Release The Clowns,https://www.youtube.com/@ReleaseTheClowns,"Seems like the boycott is working!

Here is more information on this situation from The Publica : 
https://www.thepublica.com/dylan-mulv...

Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of Bud Light, has suffered a loss of more than $5 billion since it announced its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a controversial transgender social media influencer.

Mulvaney ‚Äî a trans-identified male ‚Äî was featured on a limited release Bud Light can. Mulvaney promoted the brand in a series of social media posts and videos. One especially viral video featured Mulvaney sitting in a bubble bath, surrounded by Bud Light cans.

Since the announcement on March 31, Anheuser-Busch‚Äôs shares have fallen by nearly 4%, with the company‚Äôs market capitalization dropping from $132.38 billion to $127.13 billion on Wednesday. The company‚Äôs shares fell by more than 1.5% on Wednesday alone.

But often, clients come to us with a finished TV spot, but no audio.  Which was the case with this Budweiser commercial.  So I mixed the voice, sound effects and music for the TV spot.

On this spot I used the voice over services of Ken Eaken as featured at http://www.voiceoverselect.com.  From there, I mixed in the music and the sound effects to match the audio.

This spot was originally voiced by George Clooney, but Budweiser did not have the rights to use George in Paraguay (or did not want to pay to use him there). Perhaps they thought, why spend the money when people may not even recognize his voice.  So they had us provide the voice and produce the audio for that market.

Queens Dem Juan Ardila ducks Post‚Äôs questions over sexual misconduct claims | New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhe6KaGVTZg&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jhe6KaGVTZg/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"Assemblyman Juan Ardila ditched a pro-bail reform rally at the Capitol on Monday before refusing to answer questions from The Post about sexual misconduct allegations made against him by two women.

The freshman Queens Democrat has avoided the press in recent weeks without explicitly saying whether he forcibly touched two women without their consent while they were intoxicated at a 2015 party.

One of the women says Ardila exposed himself and forcibly kissed her as well.

‚ÄúI put my statement out and am focusing on doing the work,‚Äù the lawmaker said during a four-minute, one-sided interview in which The Post pressed him to clarify his contradictory statements about whether he did what he is accused of.

Fellow Democrats have mostly shunned Ardila, 29, ever since the Queens Chronicle revealed the accusations against him on March 13, weeks after he took office.

*This transcript was generated by a third-party transcription software company, so please excuse any typos.

A nonprofit conservative group called Consumers Research has launched a new app that will let shoppers know which products they want to buy are woke, so that of course they can avoid those products. To put it another way, a conservative group has put together this app so that other conservatives don't have to worry about any products that might hurt their little feelings because there's such snowflakes that, God forbid you buy a product from a company that doesn't 100% share your values. That's how terrified Republicans are of buying these so-called woke products. Even though not a single person there on the right can tell you what woke actually means. Now here's the thing. These corporations that Republicans are going after, you know it, it doesn't matter if it's Anheuser-Busch, it doesn't matter if it's, you know, the coolers, the coffee makers, uh uh, the shoes, the other beverages, the books. 

A lot of the parent companies of these products share the same values as Republicans. Like we don't think people should have time off work. We think we should be able to pay them lower than minimum wage. We don't want to have have to offer benefits to them while they work for us. We don't wanna have to do anything to keep them safe. We wanna be able to pay them below minimum wage. That's what a lot of these companies that Republicans are now boycotting stand for, which is pretty much what the Republican Party stands for. The only area where there's a slight bit of difference, and most of that difference really is just for the cameras, is on social issues. That's it. But social issues are the only thing that matters to Republicans these days. It's a losing issue for them. They're not doing well with it. They're going to get trounced in 2024 because of it, but here they are with a new app that will let them take it and run with it. 

Do what you gotta do, guys. Listen, vote with your dollars. I get it. But think about this for a second. Republicans are out there boycotting, you know, whether it's books or coolers or coffee makers or beers, because those products at one point said, Hey, you know what? Let's kind of be inclusive a little bit. That's it. Now, when, when people on the left, when the progressives go out there and boy, uh, boycott a company, it's because, hey, this company just dumped these cancer causing toxins into the river and a hundred thousand people are gonna die in the next 20 years. Or, Hey, this company is so bad, they're making people pee in jars and not letting them get a break so they can go to the bathroom. It's a crap company. Let's not shop there. 

So do you see the difference between the boycotts on the left and the right? The right is like, oh my God, a transgender person is drinking Bud Light. Now I have to hate them, versus liberals or leftists who say, you know what? It's probably not a good idea to shop at a company that's making people pee and bottles because they're mistreating them so badly. But even then, we don't have to have a little app on our phone to tell us, oh no, you're touching a bad product. You know why? Because we're not the ones who are the delicate little snowflakes. That distinction rest with conservatives alone.",budweiser,0.41901558387269994

Bud Light STRIKES BACK! Mocking FANS & Going BROKE! YouTube BANNING Dylan Mulvaney & Matt Walsh Talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-dE6ocv08U&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3-dE6ocv08U/maxresdefault.jpg,Don Khan Swaylo,https://www.youtube.com/@DonKhanSwaylo,"A new Bud Light sign mocks consumers in Toronto. Unfortunately, there are no more Bud Light consumers and the sign is also a fake. Even though it is a deep fake, it's still not out of the realm of possibilities for it to be true. Some executives are probably thinking it anyway.

Benny Johnson made up an inflammatory title, claiming BANKRUPTCY was on the horizon for Anheuser-Busch. Another claim is that sales have PLUMMETED by 50% and every other click-baity title you can think of was asserted. While the numbers are a bit inflated and the claims are hyperbolic, the truth is that Bud Light sales are down and baby Budweiser is feeling the pinch.

Multiple YouTubers are feeling the pinch when it comes to covering this topic. Tim Poll had two videos taken down, The Quartering had another removed, and Matt Walsh lost demonetization from his channel. If this is what is happening to moderate creators, the censorship scythe is coming for us all ahead of the most inclusive and diverse Pride Month ever. All hail our gender non conforming overlords and their leader Dylan Mulvaney!

Riley Gaines says Nike and Tampax are degrading women by sponsoring transgender Dylan Mulvaney,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk4N8Dv3tKI&pp=ygUJQnVkd2Vpc2Vy,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Fk4N8Dv3tKI/maxresdefault.jpg,The Washington Examiner,https://www.youtube.com/@washingtonexaminer,"Riley Gaines, the former collegiate swimmer who went up against Lia Thomas, is dismayed by brands endorsing transgender TikTok star, Dylan Mulvaney. Brands producing female products, like sports bras and tampons, have controversially lined up to give promotional deals to Mulvaney.

‚ÄúI find it offensive. It's a mockery!‚Äù Gaines exclaimed. ‚ÄúIf you watch this promo video of Dylan with the Nike apparel. He's doing these jumping jacks and stretching. Indicating that's how women look when we work out. That's not what we look like!‚Äù
