Best of the Best | BGT Andrew Lancaster Audition

Britain's Got Talent 2023 is shaping up to be one of the most controversial seasons yet, but this video looks back at a Trump impression BGT audition from comedian Andrew Lancaster that has left Simon Cowell and the other judges speechless. 

One of the most talked-about Trump impression moments, comedian Shane Gillis gave a spot-on impression of former President Donald Trump. Gillis' impression is not the only one that has made waves. Jamie Foxx also gave a memorable impression of Trump, while Laura Benanti has been praised for her impression of Melania Trump.The Trump impressions have been a hit with viewers, but they have also drawn criticism from some who believe that they are in poor taste. Only time will tell if the Trump impressions help or hurt Britain's Got Talent ratings. However, one thing is for sure: they are sure to get people talking.

ABOUT 'GOT TALENT'
Got Talent is a British talent show TV format developed by Simon Cowell's SYCOtv company and owned by Fremantle Media Ltd. It has spawned spin-offs in over 70 countries, in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by Fremantle of the 'Idol' and 'The X Factor' singing show competition formats. Unlike those shows, Got Talent showcases a wide variety of artistic disciplines in addition to singing.

'Got Talent' was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by Guinness World Records. Cowell stated, ‚ÄúI am very proud that Got Talent is a home grown British show. We owe its success to a group of very talented producers all over the world who have made this happen. And of course amazing talent.‚Äù

The original! The whole world was watching for the inauguration of the 45th president of the United States: Donald J. Trump. Because we realize it's better for us to get along, we decided to introduce our tiny country to him. In a way that will probably appeal to him the most.

Sunday with Lubach - as good as news

Seven days of news in thirty minutes, satirically remixed by Arjen Lubach. With irrelevant stories from relevant guests. Or vice versa. From Theater Bellevue in Amsterdam: flat content and profound jokes.

Every Sunday we publish new videos from the last television broadcast or exclusive videos that we publish exclusively on youtube. #ZML

Mike Pence testifies to federal grand jury about Donald Trump's democracy-busting January 6 crimes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTy7meJnRF4&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sTy7meJnRF4/maxresdefault.jpg,Glenn Kirschner,http://www.youtube.com/@GlennKirschner2,"Donald Trump's former Vice President, Mike Pence, just testified for eight hours before a federal grand jury investigating Trump's criminal responsibility for the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. 

Trump waged a relentless pressure campaign against Pence, urging him to violate the law - the Electoral Count Act - and refuse to certify Joe Biden's election win. 

This video discusses how and why Pence's testimony is some of the most directly and sharply incriminating evidence any witness can offer against Trump.

House leaders have faced complaints from Republicans from high-tax states over the loss of deductions for most state and local taxes, but indicate they have the needed 218 votes to pass the bill.  But Republican Sen. Ron Johnson blasted the Senate bill for favoring corporations over other businesses. Meanwhile, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who helped tank the GOP's Obamacare repeal, is raising doubts about the decision to include an end to Obamacre's individual mandate that people buy insurance.

Those close to Trump are wanting him to sit out and declare that he's going to be the winner regardless of what happens on that stage, but that's not how things work in the real world. Trump needs to face tough questions, as Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains.

Donald Trump doesn't want to debate. He doesn't wanna show up and have to talk to all of those other Republicans running for president. He doesn't wanna have to face the tough questions, and he just kind of wants to get that nomination and move on with his life and win the White House and become a dictator here in the us. And according to a new report from the bull work, it appears that a lot of Donald Trump allies are also pushing him to please skip those debates. Let me read this. It's ultimately President Trump's call, and I trust his political judgment more than mine said. Senator j d Vance of Ohio, he'll do fine in any debate you've seen him. I'm sure he'll be fine in any debate that he undertakes. I just don't know if it's the best strategy, said Republican Senator Bill Haggerty from Tennessee, Senator Tommy Tuberville, who skipped his own initial primary debates with Jeff Sessions, said quote, I missed my first couple, just for the simple fact that I'd been out there longer working at it, and people knew more about what I was saying than anybody else. 

So he's also excusing like, eh, I skipped mine. I turned out fine. Why can't Trump skip his? But all of these people know the same thing that you and I know Trump does not do well in debates. There was not a single debate, whether it was in the 2015, you know, lead up to the 2016 primaries and caucuses, whether it was in the 2016 debates against Hillary Clinton or the 2020 debates against President Biden. Not a single one where people walked away, a majority of them, and said, Trump won that debate. That simply didn't happen, folks. It didn't happen. And these Republicans are lying to you that, oh, well Trump does great in debates. Even Lauren Bobert recently said, oh, that's where Trump shines. No, it's where Trump comes across as a massive bully. Turns off independence and moderates. He also occasionally gets a couple people asking him tough questions. 

So he looks like a complete and total fool. Trump does not debate well because he's not very smart politically. That's why all of his allies want him to stay out of it. It's not because, oh, he is just so great. He doesn't even need to do it. It's he'll get his butt kicked if he does this. And we don't wanna see that happen. We want him to be the nominee because we're all very, very stupid people. I wish somebody would just say that, like that's the point we're at now. The polls show Trump can't beat Biden. The polls show, and this is polls right now. They could change. I get it. Sure. The polls show he can't beat Biden. The polls show he can't win a general election. The polls show that a vast majority of the people in this country hate him and believe that he has committed crimes. So why are 

You pushing, like, why are you defending this guy? You know, he will not win. So basically you're saying we want him to be the nominee because we're ignoring reality. We're ignoring all of the horrible things he's done that the rest of the country remembers and they're still holding against him and will continue to hold against him. But you know, whatever, we're just gonna do it because we're all a bunch of idiots who don't know any better. That's what the Republican party is telling us, but at least they're smart about one thing. In spite of what they're saying publicly about Trump's performance and the debates, they all know that he's really, really bad at it, and that is why they don't want him to do it.",donaldTrump,0.6749748704774197

Lyrics ""Se√±orita"" by Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello:
I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la
Yeah no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah
I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me se√±orita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
All along I've been coming for you
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for you
Coming for you, coming for you, coming for you
For you 
For you
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you",donaldTrump,0.6610314254707385

Lyric:
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doing something unholy
He lucky, lucky, yeah (ooh)
He lucky, lucky, yeah (ye-yeah)
He lucky, lucky, yeah
He lucky, lucky, yeah
A lucky, lucky girl
She got married to a boy like you
She'd kick you out if she ever, ever knew
'Bout all the - you tell me that you do
Dirty, dirty boy
You know everyone is talking on the scene
I hear them whispering 'bout the places that you've been
And how you don't know how to keep your business clean
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doing something unholy
He's sat back while she's dropping it, she be popping it
Yeah, she put it down slowly
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at
Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome, so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doing something unholy (woo)
Mmm, daddy, daddy, if you want it, drop the add'y (yuh)
Give me love, give me Fendi, my Balenciaga daddy
You gon' need to bag it up, 'cause I'm spending on Rodeo (woo)
You can watch me back it up, I'll be gone in the a.m
And he, he get me Prada, get me Miu Miu like Rihanna (ah)
He always call me 'cause I never cause no drama
And when you want it, baby, I know I got you covered
And when you need it, baby, just jump under the covers
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doin' somethin' unholy
He's sat back while she's dropping it, she be popping it
Yeah, she put it down slowly
Oh-ee-oh-ee-oh, he left his kids at
Ho-ee-oh-ee-ome, so he can get that
Mummy don't know daddy's getting hot
At the body shop, doin' something unholy

Donald Trump has many expensive homes and New York penthouses, but the most famous of his properties is Mar-a-Lago, the exclusive waterfront private club in Palm Beach, Florida. Estimated to be worth as much as $300 million, Trump bought the resort for an amazing deal after its original owner, Marjorie Merriweather Post, gave it to the government. With tons of gold accents and rooms built to resemble European palaces, the mansion and its sprawling estate are filled with expensive antiques and furniture, like a 1927 Steinway baby grand piano worth as much as $150,000. Trump has also made many extravagant renovations to the property, including a $7 million grand ballroom with gold leaf decorations, which is where he married Melania Trump. 

Of course a club this exclusive charges huge fees for membership. We're talking a $200,000 initiation fee plus yearly dues of $14,000. But this price gives guests access to all the property‚Äôs many amenities, including spas, a beach club, and tennis courts. The Secret Service has also been charged up to $650 a night when they stay there, and these costs are expected to go up after some Secret Service agents move into the mansion once Trump leaves office. Mar-a-Lago also has a lot of secrets, like a library full of rare, first editions books. Here‚Äôs a look at the property which cost more than $120 million to build, and the renovations Donald Trump has added to the club to make it fit for a king.

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)
I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road

Lyrics
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Answer the phone
""Biden, you're no good alone
Why are you sittin' at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's comin' to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
As it was
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

Speaking to Nigel Farage in an interview for GB News, the former president attacked the decision of his ""incompetent"" successor to send Jill Biden, the First Lady, to lead a delegation.

Mr Trump said: ""I don't think he can do it physically, actually. I think that it's hard for him to do it physically, I think, getting over here for him. He's got a lot of things going on, and a lot of strange things happen. But certainly he should be here as a representative of our country.""

He went on to claim Mr Biden would be ""sleeping"" instead of attending the historic occasion. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be in Delaware where he spends a lot of time‚Ä¶ So I don't know, but I was very surprised to see. I think it's very disrespectful for him not to be [attending].""

Lyric:
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing
You should've heard those knocked out jailbirds sing
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Spider Murphy played the tenor saxophone
Little Joe was blowin' on the slide trombone
The drummer boy from Illinois went crash, boom, bang
The whole rhythm section was a purple gang
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock
Number 47 said to number three
""You're the cutest jailbird I ever did see
I sure would be delighted with your company
Come on and do the Jailhouse Rock with me""
Let's rock
Everybody, let's rock
Everybody in the whole cell block
Was dancin' to the Jailhouse Rock, Rock, Rock

'I Was Right About Everything': Former President Donald Trump Speaks to CBN | FULL INTERVIEW,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b37kIrOMyng&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/b37kIrOMyng/maxresdefault.jpg,CBN News,http://www.youtube.com/@CBNnewsonline,"PALM BEACH, Fla.  - When our CBN News crew met a relaxed Donald Trump at his home at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida Tuesday, there was plenty to talk about, specifically, the recently leaked Supreme Court draft opinion that could overturn Roe v. Wade.  

""Well, we don't know exactly if that's true, because it was certainly something that they're working on I would imagine, I don't think anyone made it up,"" said the former president. ""They don't know who leaked it. I will say the leak was a terrible thing. You're just not used to that for the Supreme Court. It was very shocking. I think it was a very bad thing for the court."" 

*Editor's note: this interview was recorded after the leak of the Dobbs decision but before the ruling was made official.

The 90-minute meeting took a different format to usual thanks to restrictions necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic. There were no standard handshake between the two presidential candidates, and moderator Fox News star Chris Wallace had a much smaller audience than usual to contend with. 

With Mr Trump, 74, telling Mr Biden, 77, ""there is nothing smart about you, Joe‚Äù, and Mr Biden branding the president ""a bulldozer‚Äù, the debate produced several heated moments.

Le acusa de ""incompetente"", de haber ""destrozado la econom√≠a"", de ser un ""corrupto"" y que su victoria ser√≠a una ""buena noticia para China y para los globalistas"".

Adem√°s, ha asegurado que antes de volver a sentarse en Despacho Oval, ""acabar√° con la guerra entre Ucrania y Rusia"", un conflicto que ""jam√°s habr√≠a ocurrido"" si √©l hubiera seguido siendo presidente. Tambi√©n ha prometido que ""evitar√° la tercera guerra mundial"".

Lyric:
They say, ""Oh my God, I see the way you shine
Take your hand, my dear, and place them both in mine""
You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

So they say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done, I'll make you do it all again

I said, ""Oh my God, I see you walking by
Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes""
Just like a monkey, I've been dancin‚Äô my whole life
But you just beg to see me dance just one more time

Ooh, I see you, see you, see you every time
And oh my, I, I like your style
You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
And now I beg to see you dance just one more time

They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy
And when you‚Äôre done, I‚Äôll make you do it all again
They say
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I've never seen anybody do the things you do before
They say
Move for me, move for me, move for me, ayy-ayy-ayy

Not everyone in the west thinks Vladimir Putin is a dangerous megalomaniac - no less than former US President Donald Trump has called the man responsible for so much death and destruction in Ukraine a genius. Now of course Trump has made a career out of being unorthodox, and the more unpredictable he is, it seems the more his supporters love him. So much so, Donald Trump is now seriously considering another tilt at the White House. And if you thought it was a wild ride last time he was the leader of the free world, you ain't seen nothin' yet.

Mr Trump made the remarks during an interview with GB News host Nigel Farage on Wednesday, local time.
 
Mr Trump praised the Queen, saying that she never made a mistake and was never controversial in decades of service.

""She was incredible, for decades and decades she never made a mistake,"" Mr Trump told the GB News host.

""I cannot think of a mistake she made, she was never controversial.

""You cannot be disrespectful to her and I think Meghan was very disrespectful to her, very disrespectful.""

Mr  Farage added that the Queen was the most popular human being in the world until her death, to which Mr Trump replied, ""I would say that is true"".

Polls in the past week have consistently showed that Trump is having serious problems, even though he still remains at the top of the Republican pack. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening.

Donald Trump went on an unhinged rant against the Wall Street Journal, a conservative paper owned by Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch, because they had the audacity to, to report on a poll that shows Donald Trump is still winning the Republican primary, but more Republican voters think Ron DeSantis would do better against Biden than Donald Trump would. That's what the poll showed. Like. It is a hugely favorable poll of Donald Trump. Except when you get to that one thing, who would you prefer to go against? Biden 41% said DeSantis. 31% said Trump. And Trump lost his mind that the Wall Street Journal decided to report on that. So he got on true social this past weekend and he said this, forgive the, the uh, the way I read this, this is how he typed it in the polls. I am beat Biden everywhere by a lot, except in the globalist inspired Wall Street Journal, one of the worst and most partisan media outlets anywhere. 

It, it's a right wing rag always has been you. Whatever it was that way with them in 2016 until I beat Crooked Hillary, now they're using the same fake playbook that I beat Ron Des Sanctimonious easily. But Biden is close. All other media outlets have me beating both by a lot. Don't buy their bull. They're fake news. There is not a single poll that I have seen for the last three months that shows Donald Trump beating Joe Biden. So let's get that clear. I look at polls every single day. I look at the aggregates of the polling, I look at the trends in the polling, and so far this year, Trump has not been able to best Biden in any poll out there. Okay, so that last line, like in every poll I beat Biden. Literally in no polls do you beat Biden. The most recent polls actually have you losing to Biden by four points, and they have Ron DeSantis losing to Biden by two points. 70% of Americans, according to other new polls, do not want Donald Trump to run again, including 44% of Republicans. You are not popular. He is popular. I will say, and I talked about this in a segment over the weekend, he's popular with his base. Sure. He's popular with Republicans as a whole. Sure. He is still the, the front runner for the Republican nomination. Sure. He's losing ground in every one of those arenas though. That'll change. It'll flip back, it'll go down again. We're 

Still so far out that anything and everything can and will continue to happen, but right now polls are getting worse for Donald Trump and that's why he's freaking out. It's not because he's mad at the Wall Street Journal, it's because he's mad that his popularity is fading now that the shock of the indictments has worn off. That's what this is. He got a big bounce in the days, like literally just a couple days following the indictment and then after that the shock wore off. People got used to it and his poll numbers started plummeting. Once again, that's what is him off. The Wall Street Journal just happens to be the focus of his anger cuz they had the audacity to talk about.",donaldTrump,0.6125025834436952

Fox News is the brash cable TV network that has dominated both the ratings and the headlines in America, delivering revenue and power to the Murdoch family empire.    
 
For decades its catch cry was ‚Äúfair and balanced.‚Äù Then along came Donald Trump. 
 
Four Corners investigates how Fox News went from a conservative voice to a 'propaganda organ' for Donald Trump that some former reporters say they're 'ashamed' to be associated with.

Crooked believes that we need a better conversation about politics, culture, and the world around us‚Äîone that doesn‚Äôt just focus on what‚Äôs broken, but what we can do to fix it. At a time when it‚Äôs increasingly easy to feel cynical or hopeless, former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor have created a place where people can have sane conversations that inform, entertain, and inspire action. In 2017 they started Crooked with Pod Save America‚Äîa no-bullshit conversation about politics. Since then, we continue to add shows, voices, and opportunities for activism, because it‚Äôs up to all of us to do our part to build a better world. That‚Äôs it. End of mission.

La Fiscal√≠a de Manhattan solicitar√° a Trump que se entregue para ser citado por los cargos, que a√∫n no se han revelado. Adem√°s, el gran jurado ha examinado otro caso similar de una modelo de Playboy que tambi√©n recibi√≥ dinero para no hablar de su relaci√≥n con Trump. Estos casos podr√≠an suponer el fin de la carrera pol√≠tica del exmandatario republicano.

""The disparity between what Donald Trump and his fans think he is and who he really is has always been a source of comedy/enragement. He and MAGA heads believe he‚Äôs a tough guy with good jokes who won election twice. His detractors think he‚Äôs a coward, a charlatan, a liar, and much else besides. There‚Äôs a lot of questionable fan art out there (and NFTs, released by the big guy himself, with more to come) depicting him as things that he‚Äôs not, including as a superhero, as a cowboy, and as both Rambo and Rocky. Now there‚Äôs AI art, and it sure is weird/offensive.""*

The taxi's waitin'
He's blowin' his horn
Already I'm so lonesome
I could die
So kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me like you'll never let me go

The Obamacare mandate requires people to purchase health insurance or face a fine. Its repeal would provide $416 billion over ten years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, although 15 million Americans might lose insurance. Leading tax-writers have warned against the idea. ''What I don&#8217;t want to do is to add things that could again kill tax reform like healthcare died over there,' said Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the House¬†Ways and Means Committee Chairman.

What does Donald Trump's indictment mean?

Here's how the New York case impacts Trump's 2024 campaign.

RELATED: Who is Stormy Daniels? What to know about the adult film star. https://bit.ly/3zq908R

Donald Trump's lawyer said Friday he will surrender to New York authorities but won't consider a plea deal, after his indictment by a Manhattan grand jury investigating a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The indictment is unprecedented and represents the first criminal charges against a former U.S. president.

Trump's lawyer, Joe Tacopina, told NBC's ""Today"" show on Friday the former president was initially ""shocked"" when notified of the grand jury's action late Thursday but ""put a notch on his belt"" and vowed to challenge the criminal case. ‚ÄúPresident Trump will not take a plea deal in this case. It‚Äôs not going to happen. There‚Äôs no crime,‚Äù Tacopina said.

Trump, who has family roots from Lewis, an island off the northwestern tip of Scotland, owns two golf courses in Scotland - one north of Aberdeen and the Turnberry resort south of Glasgow - and the Doonbeg golf resort in Ireland.

Trump, 76, who launched his election campaign last November for the 2024 U.S. presidential election, said he was visiting to ""see and inspect"" his properties in Scotland and Ireland.

The trip comes weeks after Trump was charged with 34 felony counts in New York in a case involving an alleged $130,000 hush payment to an adult film star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.

Accounts released in February showed that the two Scottish golf courses lost 4.4 million pounds ($5.5 million) in 2021.

Michael Cohen: Does Donald Trump have a 'secret' pardon? | 60 Minutes Australia,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8o2og-tLj8&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o8o2og-tLj8/maxresdefault.jpg,60 Minutes Australia,http://www.youtube.com/@60MinutesAU,"Subscribe here: http://9Soci.al/chmP50wA97J Full Episodes: https://9now.app.link/uNP4qBkmN6 | Power of Attorney (2021)

He may no longer be President, but Donald Trump can‚Äôt stop making headlines. In the next few days he goes on trial in the US Senate charged with inciting his supporters‚Äô rampage on the Capitol building last month. But while the world was shocked by the shameful attack on democracy, Trump‚Äôs former attorney, Michael Cohen, wasn‚Äôt surprised at all. In fact two years ago he predicted it. Cohen used to be The Donald‚Äôs closest ally but ended up an enemy, and in prison, when he took the fall for covering up Trump‚Äôs affair with porn star Stormy Daniels. And now, in an extraordinary interview with Tara Brown, filmed while he serves the remainder of his sentence under house arrest in New York, Cohen is happy to spill all of his old boss‚Äôs dirty secrets.

Donald Trump's outlandish claims the election was rigged have been a legal nightmare for Fox News. As this case wraps up, several others continue against the network.

Two years ago, Four Corners reporter Sarah Ferguson investigated how Fox News promoted Donald Trump's propaganda and helped destabilise democracy in America.

This is an update to that special investigation, in light of the Dominion settlement.

Donald Trump Speech I Trump Vows To Crush Biden In 2024 Presidential Polls | Trump Vs Biden in 2024,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFwG1w0kXTw&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gFwG1w0kXTw/maxresdefault_live.jpg,CNN-News18,http://www.youtube.com/@cnnnews18,"Donald Trump Speech I Trump Vows To Crush Biden In 2024 Presidential Polls | Trump Vs Biden in 2024

DISCLAIMER: This Video may contain potential allegations that might contradict or are not confirmed by CNN News18.

Former President and 2024 Republican Presidential Candidate Donald Trump delivered remarks at a campaign event in Manchester, NH. During his speech, he said that he would retire using his ‚ÄúCrooked Hillary‚Äù moniker for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and talked about what he saw as failures of the Biden Administration. After his remarks, the former president took a few questions from the audience. This was his first public campaign event in New Hampshire, which was slated to hold the first GOP presidential primary in 2024, since he announced his campaign shortly after the 2022 midterms.

In New York, the woman who accused Donald Trump of raping her decades ago sat on the stand for a second day. In Washington, former Vice President Mike Pence testified before a federal grand jury, part of the special counsel investigation into the former president‚Äôs efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

But in Manchester, hundreds of miles away, those legal troubles were far from the focus as Trump spent more than an hour on Thursday riling up his faithful over the economy, international trade tariffs and his newly nicknamed adversary ‚Äî‚ÄúCrooked Joe‚Äù Biden ‚Äî in a key early state ahead of next year‚Äôs presidential election.

The former president‚Äôs polling lead over his 2024 Republican rivals has grown as his legal morass deepens. A recurring joke he made again Thursday about being served a subpoena if he so much as flies over a Democratic-leaning state drew laughs and applause from those attending.

Trump supporters at his campaign rally in downtown Manchester were unfazed by the latest developments in his legal woes, accusing Democrats of weaponizing the judicial system against the former president and dismissing as more noise the civil defamation lawsuit in which Trump is accused of rape.

Lyric:
At first I was afraid, I was petrified
Kept thinking I could never live without you by my side
But then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along
And so you're back
From outer space
I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
I should have changed that stupid lock, I should have made you leave your key
If I'd known for just one second you'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go, walk out the door
Just turn around now
'Cause you're not welcome anymore
Weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?
You think I'd crumble?
You think I'd lay down and die?
Oh no, not I, I will survive
Oh, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll stay alive
I've got all my life to live
And I've got all my love to give and I'll survive
I will survive, Bing bong

And the RNC censures Representatives Cheney and Kinzinger for participating in the Jan. 6 committee. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi¬†

Former Vice President Michael Pence said Friday that his former boss, ex-President Donald Trump, is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù to claim that he could have overturned the results of the 2020 presidential election.

‚ÄúPresident Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election,‚Äù he said in a speech to a gathering of the Federalist Society, a conservative legal group. ‚ÄúThere are those in our party who believe that, as the presiding officer over the joint session of Congress, that I possessed unilateral authority to reject Electoral College votes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúAnd frankly, there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president.‚Äù

Pence‚Äôs remarks represent the harshest language to date by the former vice president against Trump, who has repeatedly spread false claims about President Joe Biden‚Äôs victory in the 2020 election. Pence‚Äôs comments came just days after Trump blasted him for failing to overturn the results of the 2020 contest when Congress tallied states‚Äô votes.

A person close to Pence told NBC News later Friday that the sharpened tone against his former boss is the result of ‚Äúseeing Trump dig his heels in even deeper and going after him more personally.‚Äù

Pence may also feel ‚Äúa sense of duty‚Äù to speak out, and ‚Äúeven if the party is pretending the election denial is ‚Äònormal‚Äô and ‚ÄòOK,‚Äô it is wrong and politically not the right way to go into a presidential cycle,‚Äù the person said, according to NBC.

An aide to Trump, meanwhile, accused Pence of being ‚Äúdisingenuous,‚Äù telling NBC that the former president ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt ask him to overturn‚Äù the election, but rather merely to send electoral votes back to the states.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs clear who actually has the Republican Party voters behind him,‚Äù the aide told NBC. ‚ÄúPence is trying to get relevance. As far as the voters are concerned, they‚Äôre not going to buy what Pence is selling.‚Äù

Trump claimed in a statement released Sunday that an ongoing congressional effort to pass legislation to explicitly prohibit the vice president from overturning the results of a president election is proof that Pence once had the power to do so.

‚ÄúWhat they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away,‚Äù Trump added earlier in the week.

The two men are both considered potential contenders for the Republican nomination in 2024 and could face each other in a future primary contest.

Pence on Friday described the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as ‚Äúa dark day in the history of the United States Capitol,‚Äù when hundreds of Trump‚Äôs supporters stormed the building and halted the process of transferring power to Biden.

Prior to the riot, Trump had heaped pressure on Pence to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù and send electoral votes ‚Äúback to the states to recertify,‚Äù claiming that if Pence ‚Äúdoes the right thing, we win the election.‚Äù Pence refused to reject the Electoral College votes, saying in a letter that he believed he did not have the power.

While storming the Capitol, pro-Trump rioters chanted, ‚ÄúHang Mike Pence,‚Äù as others displayed a noose outside the building. Trump later defended those rioters, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs common sense that you‚Äôre supposed to protect. How can you ‚Äî if you know a vote is fraudulent, right? ‚Äî how can you pass on a fraudulent vote to Congress?‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs pressure on Pence to overturn the election has led senators from both parties to consider changes to the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which outlines guidelines for resolving presidential election disputes and certifying results.

Yesterday Donald Trump suffered yet another humiliating legal defeat. And honestly, it's getting to the point where I just need to record that one line so we can just play it over and over because I'm having to say it at least once a week. But yes, folks, yesterday Donald Trump suffered another legal defeat in court. This one stemming from a lawsuit that he had filed against both the New York Times and his niece, Mary Trump. In his lawsuit, Donald Trump had alleged that Mary Trump and the New York Times and their reporters engaged in a quote, insidious plot to take him down by, of course, releasing some of his, his tax materials that Mary Trump had in her possession as a result of the, the family drama with the wills and all that crap. So she had some information. She worked with the New York Times reporters. Donald Trump sued because of this so-called insidious plot, which is what he called it in the lawsuit. 

And yesterday, a member of the New York State Supreme Court, smacked the lawsuit down against the New York Times, while not ruling on the separate lawsuit against Mary Trump, but effectively ended Trump's suit against the New York Times. The judge said, the, the case quote, fails as a matter of constitutional law and said that news gathering is quote, the very core of protected First Amendment activity. So the court basically is telling Trump like, you can't get mad just because they reported something. You cannot be angry because they're engaging in protected speech under the Constitution. Your lawsuit is unconstitutional. Now, you would think that the lawyers who took on this case for Donald Trump would've warned him about this, and maybe they did. I can't say that they did or that they didn't. But any good lawyer who looked at this case had to have thought, there's no way, like, we're going to get in trouble for filing this. 

And of course they did. Donald Trump now has to pay the legal fees for the New York Times for filing such a frivolous lawsuit against them. So not only did the case against the New York Times get thrown out, but now Trump has to pay them money instead of getting money from them. And it should also be noted. And this Donald Trump off as well. The New York Times won a Pulitzer for their reporting. So you lost the case. You have to pay them money, and they got the Pulitzer. So everything is going wrong for Donald Trump. And while we're talking about legal cases in New York, it's also worth noting that 

Yesterday in the Eugene Carroll trial, Donald Trump's lawyer, Joe Taina, proudly announced that, guess what? Uh, we're not gonna be calling any witnesses of our own. That's not smart. Uh, definitely not what you wanna see in a, uh, civil criminal defense case, because this is not criminal. It is civil, but it's dealing with a criminal matter. And Taina says, we're not calling any of our own people to, to defend Donald Trump, to refute what, uh, Carroll and her legal team have had to say, no, we're, we're kind of done. We don't feel like fighting this. Um, that's a pretty big screw up on behalf of Taina. So I'm willing to bet probably within the coming days, I'm gonna have to sit here once again and tell you that Donald Trump suffered another humiliating legal defeat because his lawyers have done such a bad job in the Eugene Carroll case. That one is of course, already starting to wrap up at this point, so stay tuned.",donaldTrump,0.4201746568519499

The footage, from last October, included a previously reported but never publicly seen exchange in which the former president mistook a picture of his accuser, the writer E Jean Carroll, for a picture of his second wife, Marla Maples. Carroll says Trump raped her in a department store in New York in the mid-1990s. She is suing for battery and for defamation, over comments he made while denying the claim, which she made in a book in 2019.

'She's accusing me of rape': Donald Trump deposition video released | SBS News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ESjN86sgSs&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1ESjN86sgSs/maxresdefault.jpg,SBS News,http://www.youtube.com/@SBSNews,"A video deposition in Donald Trump's civil rape trial was released on Friday (May 5) and showed the former U.S. president defending private comments he made in 2005 about grabbing women sexually without asking.

Trump was asked by a lawyer for his accuser, the writer E. Jean Carroll, about the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape, where he said on a hot microphone that ""when you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything... Grab 'em by the p***.""

""Historically, that's true, with stars... if you look over the last million years,"" Trump said in the video deposition taken last October and shown to the jury on Thursday (May 4), the seventh day of the rape trial in Manhattan federal court.

The ""Access Hollywood"" tape was first made public in October 2016, a month before Trump was elected U.S. president.

Carroll, 79, has testified that Trump, 76, raped her in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan in the mid-1990s, and then tarred her reputation and career by lying about it online.

A social media and marketing expert hired by Carroll told jurors on Thursday that the cost to repair the reputational damage of Trump's statements could range from $368,000 to $2.8 million. Carroll is seeking unspecified damages.

Trump's lawyers rested their case on Thursday without calling any witnesses, paving the way for closing arguments on Monday (May 8) after a break on Friday.

Trump has not been in the Manhattan courtroom so far, but on Thursday he told reporters during a trip to Ireland that he would probably attend.

Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, has said he could not have raped Carroll, because ""she's not my type"" and has called the case politically motivated.

'IT'S MARLA,' TRUMP MISTAKENLY SAYS OF ACCUSER'S PHOTO

In an excerpt on Thursday from the October video deposition by Carroll's lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to Judge Kaplan, Trump also mistook Carroll for an ex-wife in a black-and-white photograph that shows him speaking to people at an event.

""It's Marla,"" he said, referring to his second wife Marla Maples.

When Kaplan asked him if he was saying the picture depicted Maples, Trump's lawyer Alina Habba said, ""No, that's Carroll.""

Carroll's lawyers have argued that the episode, made public in January, undermines Trump's argument that Carroll was not his type.

In the deposition, taken last October at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump reiterated his denials of having raped Carroll, whom he called ""mentally sick.""

""You know it's not true too,"" Trump said, addressing Kaplan. ""You're a political operative also. You're a disgrace.""

Judge Kaplan warned last week that Trump could face more legal problems if he kept discussing the case. He did not address Trump's latest comments before trial resumed on Thursday.

The trial is expected to extend into next week.

Donald Trump Gives Jim Jordan The WORST Compliment A Politician Could Get,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPO5sDHoaNE&pp=ygUMRG9uYWxkIFRydW1w,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UPO5sDHoaNE/maxresdefault.jpg,Farron Balanced,http://www.youtube.com/@FarronBalanced,"During a recent interview on Fox News, Donald Trump accidentally gave Jim Jordan the worst compliment a politician could receive. Trump compared himself to Richard Nixon (a big no-no in politics) and then said that the difference between him and Nixon is that Nixon had nobody to defend him - but Trump then said that he has ""great Jim Jordan."" That's certainly not a good look for Jordan, as Farron Cousins explains.

*This transcript was auto-generated. Please excuse any typos.

During an interview with Fox News host Mark Levin that aired this past weekend, Donald Trump gave Jim Jordan a compliment, actually praised Jim Jordan. But the compliment was actually so bad that it somehow makes Jim Jordan look even worse than he already does. Because what Donald Trump had done, and I'll read you the quote in just a moment, but Trump had compared himself to Richard Nixon and said, you know, the difference between him and Nixon was that Nixon didn't get along with Congress, which is why they were gonna kick him out. But luckily Trump has good old folks like the great Jim Jordan that have his back. So you basically compared yourself to a criminal that Republicans love to not talk about. Pretend he didn't exist. And then you say that luckily you have people willing to defend your criminal actions like Jim Jordan. Cuz you know, if you didn't, you probably would've met a similar fate to Nixon. 

But thank God for Jim Jordan, right? He doesn't care about your corruption. He thinks you're just the bees knees and he's gonna do whatever he can to protect you, which doesn't say much to Jim Jordan's character at all. Jim Jordan, by the way, does have a history of protecting people doing horrible things. As I'm sure everybody is aware, here's what Donald Trump said to Mark Levin. I'll never forget when that happened. We had such great support. Nixon had no support comparing the impeachment of Trump to the potential incoming impeachment of Nixon that was happening at the time. You know, he just didn't have support. He was very, very tough with people. I, I get along with people. I mean, I have great Jim Jordan and all these congressmen are great. They're really incredible people. Nixon didn't get along with the people in Congress. He didn't get along with the senators. 

But the fact is, we have some great people in the Republican party, but I get along with them and they stuck together. They stuck together to defend you from your criminal activities. I mean, you were impeached. You just weren't technically convicted. So I guess we can't actually call you a criminal. You're alleged criminal activities. And, and that's, that's why they're so darned great, right? They didn't care about the corruption, they didn't care about the Capitol riot and the destruction that you caused. I mean, both physically and mentally on the nation. Nope. People like Jim Jordan stuck up for me and said, we care more about you than we do the very fabric of the United States of America. Again, not exactly the kind of compliment you wanna get, right? Cuz you're also pointing out not just how corrupt Jim Jordan is and where his priorities lie, which is protecting Trump, not the American public. You're also reminding the public that there was a time when Republicans did hold 

Their own accountable, cuz Trump continued talking about Nixon. They went over there one evening, Barry Goldwater headed up the delegation and they had some senators and some congressmen, and they went over to tell him he's gotta get out. And he left the following day or the following morning. And his biggest regret was, was that he didn't fight because it wasn't really like him. And I find that very interesting. He was a very tough guy. He was, I guess some people would say this about me too. He was his own worst enemy. I mean, I can say that a little bit about myself, much less so than people think. I will say, stop comparing yourself to other criminals. I mean, especially when like, you've, you've been indicted on criminal charges, not civil charges like what the New York Attorney Generals hit you with. Those are civil, you've been indicted on criminal charges. 

You, you could literally, it's not impossible to think in your future jail is there and you're like, well, I'm just kinda like Nixon. I'm sure every Republican in the country is thinking like, could just, just shut, just shut the F up right now. Like stop talking. You're making it so much worse. And I'm, I'm sure Jim Jordan is probably publicly like, eh, I got a compliment from Trump. Yay. But in the back of his mind, he's like, dear God, can you please leave me out of any discussion about Nixon?",donaldTrump,0.38629197648205305

Again, it may not seem like it, but this is a veiled calling out of Trump, as Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains.

Donald Trump has made it clear both last week in a statement to the Republican National Committee and during his rally in New Hampshire, that he wants nothing to do with the Republican presidential primary debates. And that is of course, because as he had said in his statement, they didn't consult him. So why would he participate? You've got people that hate Trump that are gonna be there, and he's not okay with that. So he's probably not gonna participate in the Republican presidential primary debates. And this week, during an interview with right-Winger Charlie Kirk, Republican representative Lauren Bobert, whether she meant to or not, accidentally called out Donald Trump for his refusal to participate in those debates. Here is what Bobert had to say. We have President Trump leading the top of the ticket on the primary for the Republican Party. And I think there's nothing better than a good President Trump debate. 

That's where we see him shine and really show that he is a leader, that he, he's here to drain the swamp as, as w as we all want to do so badly and hold these people accountable. So I fully support a Republican primary Now. Now, bobber, of course, is wrong about all of that. Let's like get that outta the way first. I'll go in more in detail that in a moment. But we're like, I fully support a Republican primary. So you're saying, Lauren, that you like the fact that there are people running against Donald Trump uhoh. That's not good. Trump's not gonna like that. You're also telling him like, you've gotta do the debates. You can't not do the debates. You can't sit these things out. So you're calling him out. You're calling him out for being a coward. Again, I don't know if you meant to do it intentionally, if it was accidental, but you still did it. You still called him out for being a spineless coward, unwilling to participate in those easy debates. As you say, after all of that is where he shines, why not do it? But let's talk about the other parts of her statement. He's telling us that he's gonna drain the swamp. He was in office for four years. He didn't drain. All right, let's get that outta the way, and let's stop pretending that draining the swamp is a real thing that he has any intention of doing. The debates are where he shines. 

There wasn't a single time after any of the Republican presidential debates that happened in 2015 that Donald Trump searched to the top of the polls. You idiot. There hasn't been a single debate whether primary or presidential, that Donald Trump has competed in, where afterwards he was declared the winner. Like not one. I know Lauren Bobert lies all the time. I know she's a very stupid person, but Charlie Kirk is sitting right there letting her say all this. And that dip doesn't have the, you know, courage 

To stand up and be like, well, hold up. Statistics literally prove you wrong. Let me, let me talk about that. But no, Charlie Kirk does. I don't even know that he knows what statistics are. I don't know that he knows how to do research. I don't know that he remembers his history because Donald Trump performed horribly in those debates. Did he do a good job of bullying everybody else on stage? Absolutely he did. But after that very first debate, Carly Fiorina became the front runner.",donaldTrump,0.36932423187036917

So tonight is CNN's Town Hall with Donald Trump from New Hampshire, and a lot of people are unhappy that CNN decided to host Donald Trump in this format, giving him his own special little airtime. But there's one person, actually a former ally and partner of Donald Trump, who's telling people, calm down with your anger, because this is likely going to backfire spectacularly on Donald Trump. And that individual, of course, happens to be Donny Deutche, as I mentioned it, former ally, former business partner of Donald Trump. And here is what he had to say yesterday about CNN's Town Hall with Donald Trump airing tonight. We have not seen him in a very, very long time. The last time we saw him with any confrontational questions was in the debate, talking about the debates between Trump and Biden from 2020. I predict we're going to see, we talked about age before. I, I don't wanna say a much older Donald Trump, but a much more beat up Donald Trump. 

I think his fastball continues to go down. I actually think this is going to benefit the Democrats, him going on there. I think a lot of the emperor clothes might come off. I hope the folks at CNN have this set up properly and isn't that really like the key? CNN could make this go any way they want. They can either have it be a, you know, hour, two hour, whatever it's gonna be softball interview with Donald Trump with nothing but friendly questions from MAGA hat wearing freaks in the audience. They could make Donald Trump look like the pillar of American politics, or they could spend two hours beating the hell out of him to the point where he walks off the stage halfway through, where he gets so flustered that he can only spend his time attacking the media. They can hit him with those hard questions that people do want answers to. 

They could ask him about the Eugene Carroll trial. Ask him, why are you not there? Why is your lawyer doing such a bad job? Why did you hire him? What happened to him? How's it going with the indictments in New York? Why are you accused of so many things? Why are you still ranting and raving about the 2020 election, even when the firms you hired and paid over a million dollars to showed that everything you said about the 2020 election was a complete and total lie? But that's up to cnn, isn't it? Donnie Deutsch is right. This really could be a a, the emperor has no closed moment. Trump could be exposed not from having no clothes. He could be exposed as a fraud to the entire country tonight. Or CNN trying to attract a conservative audience could be as nice as humanly possible to this man 

And continue rehabbing his image in an attempt to bring in more of that conservative base. It's up to them, and that's the scary part. CNN doesn't necessarily make very good business decisions. They, they don't really have a moral compass either. They want ratings. That's why Trump is going on there in the first place. But if you want people to talk about this for a long time after it's done, the smartest thing you could do to boost your ratings is make Donald Trump as uncomfortable as possible, make him freak out by asking him tough questions. You want clips of this to go viral. That's what you have to do. Otherwise, you're just helping him rehab his image. And that's not gonna win you any audience. And it certainly is not gonna give you any clips that people are gonna be talking about for days to come.",donaldTrump,0.3557758779851111
