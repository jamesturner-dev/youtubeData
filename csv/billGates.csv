Motivational Success Story Of Bill Gates - From College Dropout To The Richest Man In The World,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4s_0pNZvnc&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q4s_0pNZvnc/maxresdefault.jpg,Inspire Yourself,http://www.youtube.com/@inspireyourselfnow,"Bill Gates Motivational Success Story - From College Dropout To The Richest Man In The World

Bill Gates was a shy and quiet boy who loved spending time in his room reading books for hours. he grew up as an introverted and antisocial kid. In high school, his original plan was to teach math. But that was until his friend Paul Allen convinced him to pursue career in computer programming. So Bill Gates quickly took his advice and wrote his first computer program at the age of 13. But his parents were not very happy, they had other plans for their child. They wanted him to pursue a law career.

So to make his parents happy, he went to Harvard to study law. But he found himself spending more time on a computer than in class. And that was because He was really happy when he was coding and law was not something that excited him. So it was  time for a bold move.

He dropped out of Harvard University to pursue his dream and formed Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. 
But everything wasn't going perfect. At first the company struggled financially. Some of their big clients went bankrupt.
So Bill Gates faced many challenges and obstacles on his path to success.

One of those challenges was Windows 1.0. Young bill Gates predicted that after it's release Windows will be running on 90 % of all computers. But he was wrong. Windows was received poorly by critics, and only 10% of computers ended using it.  And that was not even close to what Bill Gates was expecting. He was disappointed. It was a big setback,  but also a stepping stone for Microsoft. After Two years of hard work and long hours Windows 2 was released. Big innovations were included, Microsoft Word and Excel were presented for the first time.So  Windows Became a huge commercial success and revolutionized the world. Finally 90% of computers were using Windows.
Bill Gates Became a Billionaire at the age of 31 and at the age of 39 he became the richest man in the world.

Bill Gates is one of the most successful people in the world, and there's a lot that can be learned from his success story.

""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" - Bill Gates

Why Bill Gates' Leonardo da Vinci Manuscript Is Worth $130 Million | Priceless | Forbes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85YcMMhvvoQ&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/85YcMMhvvoQ/maxresdefault.jpg,Forbes,http://www.youtube.com/@Forbes,"How does Forbes estimate the value of a one-of-a-kind piece of art? In this episode, we look at the only Leonardo da Vinci manuscript that is still in private hands after more than five centuries: the Codex Leicester. Back in 1994, the estate of original Forbes 400 member Armand Hammer put the Codex up for sale at Christie’s. The new buyer? None other than the country’s richest man that year: 39-year-old Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates. 

At the time, Gates paid $30.8 million for it. But what is it worth today? To figure this out, we dove into the world of rare books, manuscripts and old masters’ works. To help us with our estimate, we interviewed experts, including old masters dealer Robert Simon, who has a connection not only to the Codex Leicester, but also to the “Salvator Mundi,” another Da Vinci work that is synonymous with wealth and power. 

Forbes reporter Michela Tindera and deputy wealth editor Chase Peterson-Withorn explain how Forbes determines the value of a one-of-a-kind Leonardo Da Vinci manuscript that Bill Gates purchased in 1994.

For more than three decades Forbes reporters have tracked the fortunes of the richest people on the planet: putting dollar figures to their business empires, their one-of-a-kind art, their private islands and more.  Now, in a new series called “Priceless,” we’re taking you behind the scenes to show you how we determine the value of the most unique assets owned by members of The Forbes 400.

Bill Gates Wasn't Worried About Burnout In 1984 – Here's Why,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhnSzwXvGfc&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MhnSzwXvGfc/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC Make It,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBCMakeIt,"When he was 28 years old, Bill Gates was confident that he wouldn't burn out by age 30. This is why he was so sure.

» Subscribe to CNBC Make It.: http://cnb.cx/2kxl2rf

Burnout is a common problem in today's workforce, even among younger employees.

But when Bill Gates was young, he was confident that it wouldn't happen to him.

Gates taught himself programming at the age of 13, and, after dropping out of Harvard, founded Microsoft when he was just 19 years old. Microsoft landed its first big contract when he was 21, and in March of 1984 — when Gates was just 28 — he told Jane Pauley on NBC's ""TODAY"" that he was expecting Microsoft to hit just over $100 million that year in revenue.

It seemed the young founder might be burning the candle at both ends. Was Gates, Pauley asked, worried about being burned out by 30?

No, he assured her. ""How do you know?"" Pauley asked.

""Well, the work we're doing is – it's not like we're doing the same thing all day long,"" said 28-year-old Gates. ""We go into our offices and think up new programs, we get together in meetings, we go out and see end users, we talk to customers. There's so much variety and there's always new things going on. And I don't think there'll ever come a time when that would be boring.""

Indeed, Gates did not burn out. He went on to build Microsoft into a massive tech empire, and became the youngest billionaire in history in 1987 when he was 31 years old, shortly after Microsoft went public. In 1995, he became the richest man in the world, with a reported fortune of $12.9 billion, a title that he held on and off for decades.

Gates, now 63, is still the second richest person the world with a net worth of $97.6 billion, and keeps busy alongside his wife Melinda as the chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable foundation, according to Forbes.

It's safe to say that for Gates, burnout wasn't really an issue. But even back when he was 28, the thought of an immense fortune isn't what drove him to work tirelessly. When asked by Pauley in 1984 whether he was in it for the money, he said that money wasn't what excited him.

""I don't think anyone at the company is in it for the money,"" Gates said in the 1984 interview. ""It's a much more exciting field than trying to measure exactly how much we're selling or how much it's worth. The creation of these programs is something you can sit down and see people enjoying and and solving real problems.""

He was also highly influential in the development of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s that have significantly shaped the culture of the world today. Gates' influence on the world has also made him a very wealthy man. From 1995 to 2017, when you think about the world’s richest man you think about Gates. He is not the richest person anymore, but $144 billion dollars is still a ridiculous amount of money. What would you do with that dough besides build a cash castle?

He was 79.

The former mayor of Cincinnati, Springer died in suburban Chicago, publicist Linda Shafran told NBC News. He died from pancreatic cancer, family spokesperson and longtime friend Jean Galvin added.

“Jerry’s ability to connect with people was at the heart of his success in everything he tried whether that was politics, broadcasting or just joking with people on the street who wanted a photo or a word,” according to Galvin.

“He’s irreplaceable and his loss hurts immensely, but memories of his intellect, heart and humor will live on.”

“The Jerry Springer Show” ran from 1991 to 2018 and was known for its profanity-prone guests who often had to be restrained by on-set security guards as audience members wildly cheered, ""Jerry, Jerry, Jerry!""",billGates,0.6659002893253707

Why Bill Gates Is Buying Up U.S. Farmland,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJVL9HegCr4&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MJVL9HegCr4/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBC,"Bill Gates made headlines for becoming the largest private farmland owner in the U.S. But he’s not the only one. Some of the wealthiest landowners including Jeff Bezos, John Malone and Thomas Peterffy are buying up forests, ranches and farmlands across the United States. Why? Watch the video to find out.

Investments in farmland are growing across the country as people, including the ultra-wealthy like Bill Gates, look for new ways to grow their money.

In 2020, Gates made headlines for becoming the largest private farmland owner in the U.S. He had accumulated more than 269,000 acres of farmland across 18 states in less than a decade. His farmland grows onions, carrots and even the potatoes that are used to make McDonald’s French fries.

“It’s an asset with increasing value,” American Farmland Trust CEO John Piotti said. “It has great intrinsic value and beyond that, it is a limited resource.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 30% of all farmland is owned by landlords who don’t farm themselves. Buyers often purchase land from farmers who have owned it for decades; many of whom may be asset rich but maybe cash poor.

“The economic realities for them are typical that they’ve spent their life farming,” said Holly Rippon-Butler, land campaign director at the National Young Farmers Coalition. “Their retirement, their equity is all in the land and tied up in selling land.”

Private landowners are also making a profit by utilizing the land in numerous ways. Approximately 39% of the 911 million acres of farmland across the U.S. is rented out to farmers, and 80% of that rented farmland is owned by landlords who don’t farm themselves data from the Agriculture Department shows.

“The young farmers are just as happy to lease the land because whether you are young or old, it’s a business, right?” said Thomas Petterfy, chairman of Interactive Brokers and owner of 581,000 acres.

“You go buy a farm and you put that cash rental lease in place, you’re going to be looking at about 2.5% return on your capital,” Peoples Company President Steve Bruere said.

He purchased the one of a kind handwritten scientific journal for $30.8 million. Bill Gates doesn’t display all his paintings. He keeps some in storage and admires digital versions. Bill and Melinda Gates have personally donated more than $50 billion to charity since 1994. In 2000, the pair formed the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which aims to fight poverty and improve healthcare in impoverished nations around the world. It’s the largest private foundation in the world holding $46.8 billion in assets. The couple has personally donated more than $36 billion to the foundation so far, and the charity has been instrumental in reducing outbreaks of diseases like malaria, polio, and tuberculosis.

During New York Climate Week, The Earthshot Prize was in New York City with 2021 finalists and winners.

In partnership with @bloombergdotorg, the event focused on driving impact around ground-breaking solutions to repair our planet.

--
Over the last ten years, the evidence that we face urgent challenges to protect the environment has become indisputable, and it’s clear that the time to act is now. Drawing inspiration from the concept of moonshots, which since the moon landing in 1969 has become shorthand to talk about the most ambitious and ground-breaking goals, Prince William announced The Earthshot Prize: an ambitious set of challenges to inspire a decade of action to repair the planet.

We believe in the power of human ingenuity to prove to us all that the seemingly impossible is possible.

In this forward-looking talk, he proposes a multi-specialty Global Epidemic Response and Mobilization (GERM) team that would detect potential outbreaks and stop them from becoming pandemics. By investing in disease monitoring, research and development as well as improved health systems, Gates believes we can “create a world where everyone has a chance to live a healthy and productive life -- a life free from the fear of the next COVID-19.”

Bill Gates: 'We need more Elon Musks',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_xIgzO2c9A&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/l_xIgzO2c9A/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC Television,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBCtelevision,"Bill Gates said in an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin that the world needs more entrepreneurs like Elon Musk to take on climate change. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

Bill Gates said the world needs more entrepreneurs like Elon Musk to take on climate change.

“I think what Elon’s done with Tesla is fantastic. It’s, you know, probably the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are part of how we solve climate change,” Gates told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview that aired Thursday morning on “Squawk Box.” “We need a lot of Elon Musks, including... ones who work on these super hard categories,” he said, suggesting areas like steel and cement.

The billionaire philanthropist also pointed toward Musk’s carbon removal challenge, which was announced last month. Musk said on Twitter that he would donate $100 million toward a prize for the best technology that can capture carbon dioxide.

“Elon’s done a carbon capture prize, which is an amazing thing,” added Gates, who has a new book called “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.” It comes at a crucial time, as global carbon dioxide emissions have soared in the past century, leading to unprecedented global warming and climate change.

“I think he should be very proud of what he’s done,” Gates said.

Bill Gates Breaks Down 6 Moments From His Life | WIRED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzUUghxDhYM&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GzUUghxDhYM/maxresdefault.jpg,WIRED,http://www.youtube.com/@WIRED,"Bill Gates reflects on six important moments from his life and career, from teaching students to program in high school to his relationships with Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, and Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, who passed away on October 15.

This video was recorded on August 31, prior to Mr. Allen’s passing, and had previously been scheduled for release this week. Bill Gates and WIRED dedicate this video to him.

Bill Gates released the following statement about his friend and colleague on October 15:

“I am heartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends, Paul Allen. From our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.


“But Paul wasn’t content with starting one company. He channeled his intellect and compassion into a second act focused on improving people’s lives and strengthening communities in Seattle and around the world. He was fond of saying, ‘If it has the potential to do good, then we should do it.’ That’s the kind of person he was.

“Paul loved life and those around him, and we all cherished him in return. He deserved much more time, but his contributions to the world of technology and philanthropy will live on for generations to come. I will miss him tremendously.”

--Bill Gates, Co-Founder of Microsoft and Co-Chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation

Bill Gates is putting his net worth of $115 billion to good work,  including spending over $60 million to make his very own high-tech haven called “Xanadu 2.0”, which is worth $154 million today. This mega-mansion in Medina, Washington has been Bill Gates’ passion project when it comes to combining technology and luxury living. Complete with hidden speakers in the wallpaper, a pin system that lets your phone connect you to the house to set preferences for temperature, lighting and entertainment, and screens worth $80,000 that display digital artwork, the Gates’ estate just might be one of the most relaxing yet high-tech homes you’ll ever virtually step into. 

With 7 bedrooms, 24 bathrooms, a 60-foot long pool in its own pool house and a library that has not one but two secret doors, Bill Gates’ mansion is like a maze just waiting to be explored. The home even has multiple garages with room for 23 of the Microsoft founder’s favorite vehicles, which include a Porsche 911 and a Ferrari 348. The home is also eco-friendly-- with a computer system that’ll even water the plants-- even though there’s some definite luxury that Bill and his wife Melinda spurged on. This includes imported sand from St. Lucia and a luxurious dining hall that can fit 200 people. Check out our video for more on Bill Gates’ epic high-tech home and how he spends his billions-- as well as how much it’ll cost for your own private tour.

Bill Gates-Backed Carbon Capture Plant Does The Work Of 40 Million Trees,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHX9pmQ6m_s&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XHX9pmQ6m_s/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBC,"In Squamish, British Columbia, there’s a company that wants to stop climate change by sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.

It’s called Carbon Engineering, and it uses a combination of giant fans and complex chemical processes to remove carbon dioxide from the air in a procedure known as Direct Air Capture.

Direct Air Capture isn’t new, but Carbon Engineering says its technology has advanced enough for it to finally make financial sense.

The company is backed by Bill Gates — but also by the oil giants Chevron, BHP, and Occidental. These partnerships will bring Carbon Engineering’s tech to market by using the captured carbon to make synthetic fuels and and help extract more oil from the ground.

Will Carbon Engineering’s technology decrease the amount of CO2 in the air, or is it going to prolong our dependence on fossil fuels?

Gates said, ""A lot of interest in manufacturing in India. Historically regulations made it tough. Great for world and India if it can be an alternate manufacturing base. I’m a great believer in free trade. If US, China and India get along, it will be the best thing for humanity. India is stepping up to a bigger role.""

In conversation with him, it's striking how frequently he cites things he's read. So he doesn't just read a lot of books, but he remembers what he reads as well.

We recently asked Gates how he does it, and he has a very specific approach, as you can see in the video above.

To start, Gates recommends getting a comprehensive overview of a topic, so that you can then understand where various details you might read fit in.

Bill Gates compares GameStop frenzy to gambling,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVBdyYynDNE&pp=ygUKQmlsbCBHYXRlcw%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PVBdyYynDNE/hqdefault.jpg,CNBC Television,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBCtelevision,"""People enjoy gambling,"" Microsoft co-founder BIll Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin regarding the GameStop short-selling frenzy. ""Sadly, you know, it's a zero sum game. You know, the idea that you drive a valuation way, way beyond what is rational, it's hard to see that societally as a good use of time."" For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

Bill Gates told CNBC the Reddit-fueled trading mania in GameStop and other stocks was reminiscent of betting at a casino and not investing.

“People enjoy gambling. Sadly, it’s a zero-sum game,” the billionaire philanthropist told CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin in an interview that aired Thursday on “Squawk Box.”

“The idea that you drive a valuation way, way beyond what is rational, it’s hard to see that societally as a good use of time,” Gates added. “And, you know, the people who get in it early get a windfall. The people who get in late feel like suckers.”

The Microsoft co-founder’s comments were broadcast hours before the House Financial Services Committee’s hearing on last month’s GameStop short squeeze. The video-game retailer’s stock skyrocketed as retail traders piled into the name, which was heavily bet against by hedge funds.

GameStop traded below $20 per share in early January, before soaring to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28 — a surge of more than 2,300%. The stock traded above $46 per share on Thursday.

GameStop had been one of the most bet-against stocks on Wall Street, and some retail traders recognized its technical vulnerability to a short squeeze. Short sellers were sent scrambling last month as Reddit users and online investors rushed into GameStop by either buying shares outright or purchasing call options.

Short sellers borrow shares of a stock and then promptly sell them back into the market, with the intention of buying back them later at a lower price. Then, they return the borrowed shares and profit off the difference. When the opposite happens, like with GameStop, shorts try minimizing their losses by purchasing the stock back at higher prices.

Social media, particularly forums like Reddit’s WallStreetBets, proved to be a powerful force during the GameStop trading frenzy. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman and Keith Gill, a prominent WallStreetBets user, are set to testify at Thursday’s hearing. Joining them are Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Gabriel Plotkin, who runs the hedge fund Melvin Capital. The fund was short GameStop during the stock’s massive runup.

Gates expressed concern about the role social media played in the GameStop saga and its potential implications for the U.S. equity market.

“Reddit forums where people have a reason to kind of push something and get out at those high prices, you know, the SEC has got to look at this because we don’t think of the stock market as just performing a casino-like role,” said Gates, the third-wealthiest person in the world. “We have restrictions on gambling activities.”

Other people acknowledge the highly speculative nature of the GameStop frenzy but contend that risky trading has long been a fixture of the market.

“Every investor is a speculator, whether you hold a stock for a millisecond or whether you own it for 10 years, and the market has to accommodate that,” Kevin O’Leary told CNBC on Wednesday.

“In investing you win and you lose. You make money, you lose money,” added O’Leary, co-founder of O’Shares ETFs and a “Shark Tank” investor.

Some have said the GameStop craze carried populist characteristics, with smaller investors trying to stick it to hedge funds and big Wall Street firms. Gates said if that really were the aim of individual investors, it will not end well.

“If the general public investor is pitted against the hedge funds, over time, the hedge funds will come out ahead,” said Gates. “I’m sure there’ll be lots of stories of people who got caught up in the frenzy, which really served no societal purpose.”

The single most important thing for avoiding a climate disaster is cutting carbon pollution from the current 51 billion tons per year to zero, says philanthropist and technologist Bill Gates. Introducing the concept of the ""green premium"" -- the higher price of zero-emission products like electric cars, artificial meat or sustainable aviation fuel -- Gates identifies the breakthroughs and investments we need to reduce the cost of clean tech, decarbonize the economy and create a pathway to a clean and prosperous future for all. (This virtual conversation, hosted by TED Global curator Bruno Giussani, was recorded in March 2021.)

Gates said the millions of online posts and ""crazy conspiracy theories"" about him and about top U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci had likely taken hold in part because of the combination of a frightening viral pandemic and the rise of social media.

""Nobody would have predicted that I and Dr. Fauci would be so prominent in these really evil theories,"" Gates said.

Gates, a billionaire who stepped down as chairman of Microsoft Corp in 2014, has through his philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, committed at least $1.75 billion to the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes support for some makers of vaccines, diagnostics and potential treatments.

Since the pandemic began a year ago, millions of conspiracies have spread over the Internet, fuelling misinformation about the coronavirus, including claims that Fauci and Gates created the pandemic to try and control people, that they want to profit from the virus' spread, and that they want to use vaccines to insert trackable microchips into people.

Ke studiu se už nikdy nevrátil. Začala tím však cesta, která z něj udělá nejbohatšího člověka světa, jednoho z nejúspěšnějších podnikatelů všech dob a respektovanou i oceňovanou osobnost (mimo jiné obdržel Řád britského impéria).

They tend to the insects’ every need as they grow from larvae to pupae to adults, keeping the temperature just right and feeding them generous helpings of fishmeal, sugar, and, of course, blood. Then, they release them across the country to breed with wild mosquitoes that can carry dengue and other viruses threatening to sicken and kill the population of Colombia. This might sound like the beginnings of a Hollywood writer’s horror film plot.  But it’s not. This factory is real. And the mosquitoes being released don’t terrorize the local population.

Gates said Epstein had promoted himself as having relationships with people who would contribute money toward global health initiatives — a focus of Gates' foundation. ""Those meetings were a mistake,"" Gates said. ""They didn't result in what he purported and I cut them off."" When asked whether there was a lesson to be learned, Gates said, ""Well, he's dead. So, in general, you always have to be careful.""

There's something out there that's as bad as war, something that kills as many people as war, and Bill Gates doesn't think we're ready for it.

""Look at the death chart of the 20th century,"" he says, because he's the kind of guy that looks at death charts. ""I think everybody would say there must be a spike for World War I. Sure enough, there it is, like 25 million. And there must be a big spike for World War II, and there it is, it's like 65 million. But then you'll see this other spike that is as large as World War II right after World War I, and most people, would say, 'What was that?'""

""Well, that was the Spanish flu.""

In a 1990 paper on ""The Anthropology of Infectious Disease,"" Marcia Inhorn and Peter Brown estimated that infectious diseases ""have likely claimed more lives than all wars, noninfectious diseases, and natural disasters put together."" 

Infectious diseases are our oldest, deadliest foe.

And they remain so today. ""In a good year, flu kills over 10,000 Americans,"" says Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""In a bad year, it kills over five times that. If we have a pandemic, it will be much worse. People think the H1N1 flu wasn’t so bad. But more than 1,000 American kids died from H1N1!""

According to the CDC, all COVID-19 vaccines currently available in the United States are effective at preventing COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can offer some protection from future illness, sometimes called “natural immunity,” but the level of protection people get from having COVID-19 may vary depending on how mild or severe their illness was, the time since their infection, and their age. Getting a COVID-19 vaccination is also a safer way to build protection than getting sick with COVID-19. COVID-19 vaccination helps protect you by creating an antibody response without you having to experience sickness. Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Getting sick with COVID-19 can cause severe illness or death, and we can’t reliably predict who will have mild or severe illness. If you get sick, you can spread COVID-19 to others. You can also continue to have long-term health issues after COVID-19 infection.
While COVID-19 vaccines are effective, studies have shown some declines in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time, especially when the Delta variant was circulating widely.
The mRNA vaccines do not contain any live virus. Instead, they work by teaching our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After making the protein piece, cells display it on their surface. Our immune system then recognizes that it does not belong there and responds to get rid of it. When an immune response begins, antibodies are produced, creating the same response that happens in a natural infection.
In contrast to mRNA vaccines, many other vaccines use a piece of, or weakened version of, the germ that the vaccine protects against. This is how the measles and flu vaccines work. When a weakened or small part of the virus is introduced to your body, you make antibodies to help protect against future infection.
Everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either 6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series, or 2 months after their initial Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine. People ages 16–17 may get a booster dose of Pfizer at least 6 months after their initial series of vaccines.
The CDC says A person is fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all recommended doses in the primary series of their COVID-19 vaccination. A person is up to date with their COVID-19 vaccination if they have received all recommended doses in the primary series and one booster when eligible.
Getting a second booster is not necessary to be considered up to date at this time. A study by The Cleveland Clinic found that both previous infection and vaccination provide substantial protection against COVID-19. Vaccination of previously infected individuals does not provide additional protection against COVID-19 for several months, but after that provides significant protection at least against symptomatic COVID-19.",billGates,0.37926874461055576
