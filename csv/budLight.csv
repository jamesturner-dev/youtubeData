Amy adds, ""But, you know, gender identity is really a spectrum. And we don't need these labels."" Seth follows: ""Beer should have labels, NOT people."" The clip also features transgender actor Ian Harvie.

This clip was considered to be a Pro-Transgender ad. The Advocate: ""It's not the first advertisement to address gender identity ‚Äî that was from Absolut vodka ‚Äî but it's a big shift from the transphobic beer commercials that we've seen before.""

MY GRANDFATHER: When I was 12 years old, I received the single best piece of business advice. My grandfather is my hero, the person I look back to who is incredibly instrumental to my desire to be an entrepreneur. He was an entrepreneur and a builder, which is one of the reasons why I feel so passionate about building. It makes me feel close to him for just a second. He is one of the people that I wish I could go back in time and share my success with.¬†Every weekend I would go over to his house and help him work. He was an imposing figure, a powerful man. But radiation and chemotherapy did a number on his body when he had cancer. He lost the ability to work as hard as he used to. When I would go over on the weekends and help him, he would talk to me about life lessons he had learned and wanted me to know. He said something that I will never forget when it comes to business. You will feed your family or your ego, but you can't do both.

YOU NEED TO BE SWITZERLAND: If you don't hear anything else I say on this channel, hear this. Shut up and sell. You need to be Switzerland when it comes to business. Too many entrepreneurs think that their opinion needs to be expressed and that they need to feel good about what they're saying. They want to take a stand on an issue when the truth is you will alienate half of your potential customers. Alienating potential customers is why I never talk about politics or anything else controversial. I don't want to risk offending anybody I would otherwise do business with. If you understand this, you can sell your products or services to everybody. As a business person, you want to take everybody's money. It doesn't matter if they're conservative, liberal, white, black, or whomever; you shouldn't care.

PERSONAL VS PROFESSIONAL LIFE: When it comes to your personal life and what you talk about with your buddies, that's fine. But do not get in the business of telling people what you think. It will ruin your business's ability to be successful. The only business you need to be in regarding your front-facing persona is the business you're in. If people are coming to you to buy tee shirts, do not try to tell them how they should act, what they should do, or how they've oppressed somebody. If you're trying to sell somebody a cup of coffee, sell them a cup. Don't preach to them to get them to be like what you want them to be. If you take a stand or a stance, you will potentially alienate 50% of your audience.

DON'T BE AN IDIOT: A great example is the Dixie Chicks, which were tone-deaf in their music lyrics. They thought talking about President George W. Bush was a good idea. After one stupid comment, their fans scattered -- all because they chose to make a stand. Just because you have an audience doesn't mean you have a duty or responsibility to tell them what you want them to hear. Preaching to an audience is something that celebrities do all the time. They talk about what they're upset about and why you should feel this way. Do not get it twisted because your job is an entrepreneur and business person is to sell. You're either going to feed your ego or your family. You can't do both. You can donate and be as woke or unwoke as you want in your personal life, but when it comes to your business audience, you need to be like Switzerland. The more people you can bring into your orbit, the more potential to sell things to them. But you're an idiot if you decide to tell them what they should or should not think when it has nothing to do with your business.",budLight,0.7015255445571426

Bud Light Backlash: 54% Support Bud Light Dylan Mulvaney Boycott,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZGoJF1OA3U&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ZGoJF1OA3U/maxresdefault.jpg,8BE,https://www.youtube.com/@8-BitEric,"Fifty-four percent of American adults support a boycott of Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light, according to polling from Rasmussen Reports.

Americans' desire to stop drinking Bud Light follows a furor that erupted a few weeks ago over the beer brand's decision to partner with controversial transgender social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

The entire controversy got kicked off when Mulvaney, a biological male who became popular on social media for a ""365 Days of Girlhood"" campaign that documented their gender transition over the course of a year, received a special edition can from Bud Light with Mulvaney's face on it as a gift for completing a full year of pretending to be a woman.

Mulvaney went on to share pictures of the can on social media, and also produced additional social media posts promoting Bud Light amid the then-ongoing NCAA Men's Division I basketball tournament, known colloquially as March Madness. One of the posts included Mulvaney in a bathtub blowing bubbles and sipping from a can of Bud Light.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski‚Äôs show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers ‚Äî loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

‚ÄúDo you like Kyle Kulinski?‚Äù

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

‚ÄúHe understands what we‚Äôre up against,‚Äù Ahmed said. ‚ÄúLike Bernie.‚Äù

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski‚Äôs name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski‚Äôs show struck me as mostly capital-P ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù takes on the news ‚Äî the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It‚Äôs an impression that wasn‚Äôt entirely incorrect.

‚ÄúI have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,‚Äù Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about Lenin. I don‚Äôt want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.‚Äù

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do ‚Äî even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚Äù

And yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚Äù

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode.

She says she wants the brand to ""evolve"" and ditch its ""frat boy"" image. Which only shows yet again that leftists don't understand the institutions they run. Also, Kamala Harris comes to Nashville. Not to visit the families of the victims of the trans terrorist shooter. Instead she came for a photo op with the so-called ""Tennessee Three."" And a jury in Texas votes to convict a man who shot a BLM protester in self-defense. But the governor of Texas has already said he plans to pardon him. Plus, the new mayor of Chicago makes the case against failing grades and homework in school. He's not as wrong as you might think.

He was born on Vaisakha Poornima. The history of his family, the Ikshvaku dynasty, is traceable to pre-Ramayana times. Renouncing the life and responsibility of a king, Siddhartha Gautama sought a solution to human misery. Ever in the midst of the great Indian religious and spiritual traditions, he noticed what was most needed by all people: Dharma, and Non-violence. He sought a direct path to salvation. He was a lone pathfinder who inspired the religions that eventually spread to China, Japan, and to the United States and Europe as late as the 20th Century.

The Secret Reason Why Bud Light Chose Dylan Mulvaney | Guest: James Lindsay | Ep 791,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwf--7CiTWU&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vwf--7CiTWU/maxresdefault.jpg,Allie Beth Stuckey,https://www.youtube.com/@AllieBethStuckey,"Today we're joined by our friend James Lindsay to discuss a few hot-button topics in the news. First we talk about Dylan Mulvaney's Budweiser sponsorship and its fallout. James explains why corporations are so obsessed with ""inclusion"" and what's on the line for them if they don't comply with ESG overlords. Then, we look at the United Nations' new report that calls for the decriminalization of all sexual activity (including pedophilia). Of course, this makes complete sense when you look at the consistent and ever-growing grooming culture among the Left. We talk about why the Left always seems to default to this and how the Right should respond. We also cover a Washington bill that would allow the state to provide sanctuary for children whose parents don't consent to transgender ""treatments"" or abortions.

On Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham called out Marjorie Taylor Green for defending Jake Tahara, the, uh, Pentagon Leaker, who Marjorie Taylor Green is trying to hold up as some kind of whistleblower, even though he, uh, wasn't leaking documents to expose crimes by the federal government or really even exposed lies by the federal government. He put our national security and the national security of multiple other countries at risk by leaking this information, not to the press, but to his friends on a message board so that he could seem cool. There's nothing whistleblower about that. So Lindsey Graham on the Sunday morning talk shows, rightfully called out Marjorie Taylor Green and all of the other Republicans that are fending, uh, uh, defending to Sherra for leaking this information to his buddies. And Marjorie Taylor Green, of course, is not one to take any kind of criticism lightly. 

She will lash out in the harshest way possible. So on Sunday evening, Marjorie Taylor Green tweeted out a photoshopped image of Lindsay Graham next to CNN n Host Dana Bash at a bar holding up one of those Bud Light cans featuring transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Now, she didn't add a caption, she just tweeted out the picture. That's it. That was her response. Trying to, I guess, somehow imply that either Lindsay Graham actually supports the rights of L G B T Q people, which, I mean, would that be a bad thing if he did it? I know it would be a bad thing in the eyes of Republicans, but that would be the best thing in the world if Lindsay Graham could jump on and be an ally to the L g BT Q community. So it's not really the burden that you think it is Marjorie, but it's also, as I said, a Photoshopped image. 

The original image, Lindsey Graham's just holding a pint of beer next to Dana Bash. It's from when he was running for president in uh, 2015. But that's what Marjorie Taylor Green thinks is a win, right? She couldn't defend her position on the merits. So she has her team, cuz I'm willing to bet she doesn't know how to use Photoshop. She has her team make up this image trying to trash Lindsey Graham as an ally of the l q community or perhaps perpetuating that criticism that maybe Lindsay Graham is, you know, somehow in the closet. We've heard that attack from both the left and the right for many, many, many years. But if you wanted to defend your point on the merits, you would've actually discussed your point. Marjorie, you don't have to result, uh, resort, excuse me, to this childish display of Photoshopping an image in order to smear a man while also perpetuating that conspiracy theory about his sexuality. 

That's a low blow. That's pretty gross actually, if you ask me. It's also pretty gross that you think holding a beer can, uh, depicting Dylan Mulvaney is somehow offensive. It's a promotional thing. Like why, why? I don't even know why Republicans are still freaking the hell out about this, but they are. Marjorie Taylor greed is trying to capitalize on it, telling her people through this photoshopped image that Lindsay Graham somehow on the other side of it, like none of it makes any sense, folks, but that's politics in 2023. Everything is stupid. Nothing makes any sense and nobody wants to talk about the real issues, especially people like Marjorie Taylor Green, who clearly don't even understand what the real issues are.",budLight,0.6436274858508921

Bud Light Backlash After Partnering With Transgender Influencer Dylan Mulvaney!!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_yri99HW-Q&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/I_yri99HW-Q/hqdefault.jpg,YouGetTheHornsShow,https://www.youtube.com/@yougetthehornsshow,"Bud Light and Anheuser Busch have been facing backlash over their recent partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a social media influencer with a history of controversial and offensive behavior online. Many people have criticized Bud Light for working with Mulvaney despite his history, arguing that it sends a message that such behavior is acceptable or excusable. Some people have even called for a boycott of Bud Light products as a result of the partnership.

Bud Light has since issued a statement in response to the backlash, stating that they ""do not condone derogatory language or behavior of any kind"" and that ""we understand the concerns raised about a recent influencer partnership and we apologize for any offense that it may have caused."" Despite this apology, it remains to be seen how the public will respond and whether the controversy will have a lasting impact on Bud Light's reputation. We discuss the ongoing backlash!

Bud Light - Ladies Night (1993),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJGjwqWqObU&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/mJGjwqWqObU/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEmCOADEOgC8quKqQMa8AEB-AH-BIAC4AOKAgwIABABGHIgQyg0MA8=&rs=AOn4CLBjMGJXgQST9LUYce2i3Q5YMkgTXw,Marketing The Rainbow,https://www.youtube.com/@MarketingTheRainbow,"Bud has a long history of Marketing the Rainbow, which goes back at least two decades, when they started a collaboration with GLAAD. Yet, their communications have not always been subtle, or supportive.

In this classic commercial from 1993, four men in drag play out their game of make believe - in ""Ladies' Night"". 

AdRespect: ""The ad isn't meant to parody transgendered persons or gays, it plays on the Ms. Doubtfire/Tootsie joke of obvious men dressing as women out of need - it's older than television. The campaign has been so successful it has run for many years and has carried variations that included Don Rickles mistakenly picking up one of the women. One variation that was shot but never aired included a Los Angeles drag queen.""

You can watch the Don Rickles version here: ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†Bud¬†Light¬†-¬†Ladie...¬†¬†
and the one called Pool Table: ¬†¬†¬†‚Ä¢¬†Bud¬†Light¬†-¬†Pool¬†...¬†¬†

Bud has been active in Marketing the Rainbow for decades. Read my blog on Bud here: https://marketingtherainbow.info/case...",budLight,0.6335020039667676

Why? Because big business executives ‚Äî especially at massive corporations like Anheuser-Busch or Coca Cola ‚Äî don‚Äôt truly care about the feelings of YOU, the consumer. But a recent video posted by an alleged Bud Light distributor about the company‚Äôs decision to use trans activist Dylan Mulvaney as a marketing tool highlights the ‚Äôsmart‚Äô way we CAN fight back, Glenn says. In this clip, he explains exactly what that strategy is. We CAN win the battle against these companies‚Äô woke nonsense, Glenn explains. We just have to be smarter.

But why are all of these companies going woke? And what can we realistically do about it? I have a plan and I'll lay it out for you today. Also, the White House refuses to endorse any age limits at all for gender surgeries for children. They say it's up to the child to choose. NPR gets devoured from within by its own left wing employees. And the classic American novel ""Gone With The Wind"" will now come with a lengthy essay condemning the book for its racism.

However, he noted, ‚ÄúDespite all of this, an expert tells CNN that once the social media backlash blows over, the long-term benefits of the company taking a cultural stand like this may be more impactful.‚Äù

Piers Morgan reacts to the backlash Budweiser received for its Bud Light advert with transgender TikTok influencer and actress Dylan Mulvaney and explains why he thinks it's never a good idea to place political stances in your product advertisement.

Piers then later uses Gilette as an example of a brand's campaign backfiring when trying to make a political statement with their product.

"Travis Tritt Boycotts Anheuser-Busch Including Bud Light, Takes a Stand Against Underage Advertising",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y3pBYgEgec&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/8Y3pBYgEgec/maxresdefault.jpg,Celebs Plus,https://www.youtube.com/@CelebsPlus,"#travistritt #boycotts #anheuserbusch 

Country music star Travis Tritt has announced that he is dropping all Anheuser-Busch products, including Bud Light beer, due to the company's recent ad campaign featuring Dylan Mulvaney. Mulvaney, a competitive gamer, has been promoting Bud Light during his livestreams on Twitch, a popular video game streaming platform. Tritt took issue with the fact that Mulvaney has been promoting the beer to his underage audience, stating that it goes against his own values and morals.

Tritt said, ""As a father and a grandfather, I find it completely unacceptable that Anheuser-Busch would use a minor to promote their products in this way. I have always been a strong advocate for responsible drinking, and I cannot in good conscience continue to support a company that is willing to exploit children for profit.""

Tritt's decision has garnered mixed reactions from fans and industry professionals, with some praising his stance on responsible advertising, while others criticize his decision as an overreaction. Anheuser-Busch has not yet responded to Tritt's statement.

This move comes as Tritt prepares for his upcoming ""No-Frills Classic Outlaw Country"" tour, which kicks off later this month. It remains to be seen if Tritt's decision to drop Anheuser-Busch products will have any impact on his tour or future partnerships.

(Yes, right now it's just me making everything)

Editor's Note: My edits were all made to keep the video on one, central topic by editing together relevant commentary from many parts of Hasan's streams to create a storyline that is still followable by the viewer. I also edited in commentary of my own in places, in addition to relevant external information that improves the viewing experience. A lot of edits were made for comedy purposes, or to enhance the comedic timing of certain beats, but never to misrepresent Hasan's point of view.

Republicans Now Panicked That Bud Light Boycott Will Cost Them A Massive Donor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBWv4-YzsAo&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zBWv4-YzsAo/maxresdefault.jpg,The Ring of Fire,https://www.youtube.com/@TheRingofFire,"Republican lawmakers are wanting their cult members to back off the boycott of Bud Light, and the NRCC even deleted a tweet attacking the product after they remembered that Anheuser-Busch is one of the Party's biggest donors. Apparently it is all fun and games until Republicans start losing money, and that could happen at any moment because the party can't stop throwing temper tantrums about everything under the sun.

Republicans are still freaking out over the Dylan Mulvaney promotion of Bud Light. And if you're not familiar, of course, bud Light recently, uh, used a transgender influencer to do a promotion for the company, like literally one video. So Republicans have spent the last two weeks freaking out claiming Bud Light has gone woke, and their little boycott of the company has now met some pretty ferocious backlash from within their own party. Donald Trump Jr. Has now put out a video begging conservatives to please back off of Bud Light and Anheuser-Busch, they don't deserve this, right? It's over with. Let it go, stop being freaks basically is what Junior says. And believe it or not, Junior's, right? But over the weekend, the N R C C, the National Republican Campaign creeps whatever the N R C C stands for. I forget at the moment. Um, they put out a tweet that said, thanks to Dylan Mulvaney, we can finally admit that Bud Light tastes like water with our new coozies. You can make sure no one confuses Bud Light with real beer ever again. 

And then a little while later, the NCC deleted that tweet because apparently they were reminded shortly after they sent it that, Hey, Anheuser Anheuser-Busch gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Party every single campaign cycle, and you're screwing us. So the NCC thought, oh, I I like money, I gotta delete the tweet. And I'm sure that had a lot to do with Don Jr coming out saying like, guys, x nay on the UD Light Bay. Right? Because we want that Anheuser Bush money because Republicans love a good woke freak out for their Republican base. But what they don't like is actually getting any backlash from it from corporations. Hell, even Disney that has been in Ron DeSantis has crosshairs for well over a year and royally screwed him over because they're much smarter. They still gave money to his reelection and his inauguration for the second, uh, term. 

Like they didn't even hold him accountable or punish him in any way. And Bud Lights over here saying, guys, listen, not Bud Light, but Anheuser-Busch, uh, you know how much money we give you, right? I mean, you can see the numbers. It's publicly available online for anyone too. You're gonna us off and you're not gonna get any more of that. We are one of the top Republican donors in the country, and you're us off. Does that, does that sound like a smart thing to do? No. No. Probably not. But here's the thing. Republicans, it's, it's beer. Okay? It's a beer. If you want to drink it, drink it. Drinking it is not going to turn you 

Transgender, okay? It's not going to make gay people straight or straight people gay. It's not gonna do any of that. It's a beer. It, it's going to increase your blood alcohol content level if that is what you're looking for, okay? If you wanna drink it, drink it. If you don't, don't. But don't get up on your idiotic high horse and act like we're superior because we're boycotting this because we're afraid of a transgender influencer, which is what you're admitting to. You're afraid of Dylan Mulvaney. It's hilarious. It's absolutely ridiculous that Republicans will find anything to freak out about. It's not like Dylan Mulvaney is going out there and doing commercial after commercial after commercial for Bud Light.",budLight,0.5847476498862629

The WOKIES now HATE BUDLIGHT... APOLOGY BACKFIRE!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m482lzLviw0&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/m482lzLviw0/hqdefault.jpg,8BE,https://www.youtube.com/@8-BitEric,"Hello, in this video, I will be discussing an article from Time Magazine about the controversy surrounding a Bud Light commercial featuring Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender man. The commercial was part of Bud Light's ""beer for everyone"" campaign, which aimed to promote inclusivity and diversity.

The ad received a lot of backlash from certain consumers who expressed transphobic views and threatened to boycott the company. Despite the backlash, Bud Light initially stood by their decision to feature Mulvaney in the ad, stating that they were committed to promoting diversity and inclusion.

However, according to the article, members of the LGBTQ+ community felt that Bud Light did not adequately defend Mulvaney after the backlash intensified. Critics claimed that Bud Light could have done more to push back against transphobia and support their transgender spokesperson.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski‚Äôs show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers ‚Äî loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

‚ÄúDo you like Kyle Kulinski?‚Äù

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

‚ÄúHe understands what we‚Äôre up against,‚Äù Ahmed said. ‚ÄúLike Bernie.‚Äù

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski‚Äôs name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski‚Äôs show struck me as mostly capital-P ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù takes on the news ‚Äî the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It‚Äôs an impression that wasn‚Äôt entirely incorrect.

‚ÄúI have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,‚Äù Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about Lenin. I don‚Äôt want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.‚Äù

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do ‚Äî even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚Äù

And yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚Äù

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode.

Senate panel passes bill to ban transgender girls from girls sports in NC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_NNvMXZVIY&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/e_NNvMXZVIY/hqdefault.jpg,WCNC,https://www.youtube.com/@WCNC,"North Carolina took its first step to join more than 20 other states in banning transgender girls from playing on girls' sports teams in middle school and high school Tuesday morning.

If enacted into law, transgender girls would be prohibited from participating in sports that correspond with their gender identity under a bill that advanced Tuesday in the North Carolina Senate.

The Senate education committee advanced the ""Fairness in Women's Sports Act"" on a voice vote with Republicans on the panel saying such a blanket ban is necessary to protect biological girls and saying that the small number of transgender girls, estimated at 15, currently participating in North Carolina is too many.

""Donald Trump Jr. called for an end to the Budweiser and Anheuser-Busch boycott that stemmed from the partnership between Bud Light and transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

The backlash has spanned several weeks after Mulvaney posted to her TikTok account ‚Äî with over 10.8 million followers ‚Äî a partnership video with Bud Light. The video prompted many right-wing customers and conservatives to call for a boycott of the brand. Stars like Kid Rock and Travis Tritt publicly condemned the brand, with Rock even taking a gun to several boxes of the beer.""*

‚ÄòDisgusted‚Äô: Bud Light faces ‚Äòmassive backlash‚Äô after Dylan Mulvaney partnership,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcrj7Hwr4k&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QYcrj7Hwr4k/maxresdefault.jpg,Sky News Australia,https://www.youtube.com/@SkyNewsAustralia,"Sky News contributor Megyn Kelly says she expects Bud Light‚Äôs woke Marketing Vice President Alissa Heinerscheid will be ‚Äúfired publicly‚Äù if the beer company wants to save its brand.

Bud Light recently partnered with transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney to promote its beer. 

The Megyn Kelly Show host said Bud Light has ‚Äúcompletely misjudged‚Äù its audience and there has been a massive backlash. 

‚ÄúPeople are dumping out their Bud Light like it‚Äôs the tea party all over again into the Boston River,‚Äù she told Sky News host Paul Murray. 

‚ÄúThey are disgusted ‚Äì not just with the fact that this brand is aligned with a trans woman who‚Äôs co-opting all these sponsorships and making a mockery on womanhood ‚Äì but with the brand‚Äôs disdain for what is obviously their customer base, which is obviously working-class guys.‚Äù",budLight,0.48166527159476263

Someone thought teaming this creator with one of America‚Äôs most famous beers would be a good idea. That right there is Dylan Mulvaney, a well-known advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, recently teamed up with Bud Light to promote a new line of gender-inclusive beer cans. The cans feature Mulvaney's face alongside the slogan ""Cheers to Being Yourself."" However, the partnership has drawn criticism from some quarters, with conservative groups calling for a boycott of the brand. But Bud Light is not backing down including Rock star kid rock who opened fire on Bud Light.

Bud Light Issues a new STATEMENT of apology!!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RvsxZDoMMs&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RvsxZDoMMs/hqdefault.jpg,Sounding Mind,https://www.youtube.com/@soundingmind,"Bud Light CEO Apology Statement

However, it appears that these anti-woke boycotts are becoming more and more effective. We appear to be beginning to exert more power than ever before. The boycotts are undoubtedly having an impact, but perhaps not in the desired way. Anheuser Bush has replied and, while not truly apologizing, has technically done so. I'll show you guys how they responded.

The vice president of marketing at Bud Light provides us with some important insight into the specific considerations the company's marketing team had before endorsing someone like Dylan Mulvaney in a footage that may have been leaked or is perhaps just from a public forum or discussion. You guys won't believe this, or you might, given that it's essentially the most logical conclusion.

I now give you Alissa Heinerscheid, vice president of marketing for Bud Light. Increasing the intensity of her extreme awoke marketing campaign to attract young consumers while disparaging her former clients.

This entire political party has gone completely off the rails with their derangement, and they are, unfortunately, showing no signs of slowing down their collective mental health crisis.

*This transcript was generated by a third-party transcription software company, so please excuse any typos.

A nonprofit conservative group called Consumers Research has launched a new app that will let shoppers know which products they want to buy are woke, so that of course they can avoid those products. To put it another way, a conservative group has put together this app so that other conservatives don't have to worry about any products that might hurt their little feelings because there's such snowflakes that, God forbid you buy a product from a company that doesn't 100% share your values. That's how terrified Republicans are of buying these so-called woke products. Even though not a single person there on the right can tell you what woke actually means. Now here's the thing. These corporations that Republicans are going after, you know it, it doesn't matter if it's Anheuser-Busch, it doesn't matter if it's, you know, the coolers, the coffee makers, uh uh, the shoes, the other beverages, the books. 

A lot of the parent companies of these products share the same values as Republicans. Like we don't think people should have time off work. We think we should be able to pay them lower than minimum wage. We don't want to have have to offer benefits to them while they work for us. We don't wanna have to do anything to keep them safe. We wanna be able to pay them below minimum wage. That's what a lot of these companies that Republicans are now boycotting stand for, which is pretty much what the Republican Party stands for. The only area where there's a slight bit of difference, and most of that difference really is just for the cameras, is on social issues. That's it. But social issues are the only thing that matters to Republicans these days. It's a losing issue for them. They're not doing well with it. They're going to get trounced in 2024 because of it, but here they are with a new app that will let them take it and run with it. 

Do what you gotta do, guys. Listen, vote with your dollars. I get it. But think about this for a second. Republicans are out there boycotting, you know, whether it's books or coolers or coffee makers or beers, because those products at one point said, Hey, you know what? Let's kind of be inclusive a little bit. That's it. Now, when, when people on the left, when the progressives go out there and boy, uh, boycott a company, it's because, hey, this company just dumped these cancer causing toxins into the river and a hundred thousand people are gonna die in the next 20 years. Or, Hey, this company is so bad, they're making people pee in jars and not letting them get a break so they can go to the bathroom. It's a crap company. Let's not shop there. 

So do you see the difference between the boycotts on the left and the right? The right is like, oh my God, a transgender person is drinking Bud Light. Now I have to hate them, versus liberals or leftists who say, you know what? It's probably not a good idea to shop at a company that's making people pee and bottles because they're mistreating them so badly. But even then, we don't have to have a little app on our phone to tell us, oh no, you're touching a bad product. You know why? Because we're not the ones who are the delicate little snowflakes. That distinction rest with conservatives alone.",budLight,0.41901558387269994

Jschlatt in yo ass you getting anal probed by OTK 

Issac keep the mask on cause he lookin like my nutsack

Grunk lookin valarant  pro with a hunchback
Yeah AV got the drip but he aint got no bitches

Willy built just like a mini pekka why he think he swole?

gamersupps dildo 2 feet deep inside his booty whole..
Funky monkey chunky funky monkey chunk im..

See I was at twitch con had to take a fucking shit
So i went into the men's bathroom so i could go and do it
But that little slide thing that you push to lock the door 
Was stuck in its place I couldn't move it any more 
But I said screw  it man and proceed too shit 
it was already poking out so i had to risk it
At first i thought it was clear pushed out the bread like a baker,
Till bigT busted in like a level 6 wall breaker
I was so damn  nervous couldn‚Äôt breathe i was strangling
He forgot to look under the door to see that my feet were dangling
My most vulnerable state mid crap on the jon
An unwipped buttwhole and no where to run
I took the bud light to alabama

Does av got drip?
Does bigt got t?
Does soft willy even got a softwilly?
I took the bud light to Alabama

She want that big ass bag, that Louie, I mean I'll cop it
She got that big ass ass, that booty, pop lock and drop it
20K's up on my wrist, I'm gone
Poppin bottles 'til the break of dawn
I took the bud light to Alabama
I took the bud light to Alabama
 Nah nah nah drunk im not done with you bitch open your mouth, turn around, gargle my balls,

However, the company is getting help from the Republican establishment, who apparently want us to back down from the Bud Light boycott in order to protect all of the donor cash that Anhueser Busch sends to Republicans. I'll explain why that's sure as hell not going to happen. Also, Chicago descended into chaos over the weekend, so no different than any other weekend. But the mayor of Chicago wants us to know that the people looting and rioting are not at fault. Plus, a democratic representative embarrasses herself while trying to make the case for men in women's sports. In our Daily Cancellation, I will be cancelling a creepy weirdo on YouTube, who also happens to be an extremely famous and successful children's entertainer.¬†

"Bud Light Embraces Trans Community, Kid Rock Responds with Violence",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuanj2cYrPc&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kuanj2cYrPc/maxresdefault.jpg,Queer News Tonight,https://www.youtube.com/@QNewsTonight,"Vile. Disgusting. Dangerous. Kid Rock seems to hate trans people and really hate their being associated with a beer company. To prove it, he posted an extremely violent video on Twitter. 
Rock, whose real name is Robert James Richie, seems angry that Anheuser-Busch, which owns Bud Light, is embracing the trans community, specifically social media influencer Dylan Mulvaney. She‚Äôs partnered with them for a clever social media campaign promoting a sports-related contest where she hugs cans of Bud Light and shows off a one-of-a-kind can with her face on it. 
The contrast is clear: Her video is light, tongue-in-cheek fun. Kid Rock‚Äôs is the opposite. He avoids making a verbal connection but the message was clear to his followers - who posted equally vile support in the comments section. More than eight million people viewed the video in the first two days.
At a time when lawmakers support legal discrimination against trans, this type of video from a rough, conservative rock star becomes especially dangerous, sending a message that could be interpreted that violence against trans people and their allies is justified.
What are they scared of? Apparently this. This is video from Trans Day of Visibility last week at the Pride Center in Wilton Manors. There were musical performances, poetry readings and more. Trans people contribute to society like everybody else, while being threatened every step of the way.
As for Mulvaney, she hasn‚Äôt responded to Rock‚Äôs video, but has posted, ‚ÄúIf you are in a position of power to hire someone trans or non-binary, please do! We need to exist in every space. I want to see trans people doing all the brand deals.‚Äù
If that happens, Kid Rock‚Äôs head will explode faster than those cases of Bud Light.
Fun facts: Bud products are prominently featured on the menu of his Nashville restaurant.
Also: While she has about 1.7 million followers on Instagram, he has fewer than a million. Sounds like a case of Follower Envy.

Bud Light STRIKES BACK! Mocking FANS & Going BROKE! YouTube BANNING Dylan Mulvaney & Matt Walsh Talk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-dE6ocv08U&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3-dE6ocv08U/maxresdefault.jpg,Don Khan Swaylo,https://www.youtube.com/@DonKhanSwaylo,"A new Bud Light sign mocks consumers in Toronto. Unfortunately, there are no more Bud Light consumers and the sign is also a fake. Even though it is a deep fake, it's still not out of the realm of possibilities for it to be true. Some executives are probably thinking it anyway.

Benny Johnson made up an inflammatory title, claiming BANKRUPTCY was on the horizon for Anheuser-Busch. Another claim is that sales have PLUMMETED by 50% and every other click-baity title you can think of was asserted. While the numbers are a bit inflated and the claims are hyperbolic, the truth is that Bud Light sales are down and baby Budweiser is feeling the pinch.

Multiple YouTubers are feeling the pinch when it comes to covering this topic. Tim Poll had two videos taken down, The Quartering had another removed, and Matt Walsh lost demonetization from his channel. If this is what is happening to moderate creators, the censorship scythe is coming for us all ahead of the most inclusive and diverse Pride Month ever. All hail our gender non conforming overlords and their leader Dylan Mulvaney!

"Man in viral Walmart beer-smashing video, charged with exposing himself to teen | New York Post",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1vr8_ZB_80&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B1vr8_ZB_80/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"A man who was seen in a viral Walmart video smashing cases of Busch Light beer in Kansas has been charged with exposing himself to a minor, according to police.

J. Dustin David Cain, 44, of Topeka, was arrested Monday night after causing a commotion at the Walmart on SW Wanamaker Road.

A TikTok video that has now been viewed more than 306,000 times shows a man, later identified as Cain, removing cases of beer from a Walmart beverage refrigerator and angrily throwing them to the floor.

When he notices that he is being filmed by an onlooker, he hurls a couple of loose beer cans into the distance, at one point narrowly missing the amateur cameraman, who is forced to dive for cover.

Police later arrive to arrest Cain, who is seen being led away in handcuffs.

Trump's Lawyers Fail Again As Judge Refuses To Delay Assault Trial,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOSkQ6GSUC8&pp=ygUJQnVkIExpZ2h0,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AOSkQ6GSUC8/maxresdefault.jpg,The Ring of Fire,https://www.youtube.com/@TheRingofFire,"*Use code ROF for 40% OFF and 3 free towels from Miracle Made at https://trymiracle.com/rof *
Donald Trump needs to be very worried about how terrible his lawyers are as he faces an assault trial next week filed by E. Jean Carroll. Trump's lawyers failed last week to get the judge to reverse his ruling about the jury remaining anonymous, and then they failed again on Monday when they tried to get the judge to delay the trial. They had argued that the recent New York indictments would make Trump look bad, but that's not the judge or plaintiff's fault, so the delay was denied. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what happened.

Donald Trump may have some of the worst lawyers imaginable going to bat for him in the Eugene Carroll assault trial that is coming up on April 25th. And thanks to a judge's ruling yesterday, we know for a fact that it is coming up on April 25th, Donald Trump's attorneys, Joe Taina and Alina Haba had filed a motion with the court recently saying, Hey, listen, judge Lewis Kaplan, I don't know if you've noticed this, but our client, Donald J. Trump is, is going through some very publicized legal problems in Manhattan, and so we would like to delay this assault trial even further so that things can cool down a bit. Judge Lewis Kaplan said, no, I'm not going to do that. This, this doesn't affect this trial. We're moving forward. April 25th is the start date. Now, specifically, Trump's lawyers had said, quote, the threat to President Trump's rights is particularly dire because the coverage of the indictment has repeated a salacious and false allegations. 

They did misspell that exactly what Ms. Carroll alleges in this case. So you didn't even bother to spell check your complaint or your motion. You submitted it anyway. You didn't offer any real reasons just other than, Hey, our guy's going through some stuff. Yikes. I don't know if you've seen it, it's pretty bad. But that's what happens when you're representing an individual that is facing investigations from multiple different bodies in multiple different states. You know, sorry for you. But that doesn't have any impact on the specific case here. Now, if this lawsuit that Eugene Carroll had filed was about financial crimes, then that might actually make sense to delay it a little bit while the other stuff dies down. But this has nothing to do with money. The two cases could not be further apart in subject matter. One of them is potentially a sexual assault. The other is falsifying business records to cover up an affair, a consensual affair. So if it makes your client look bad, that's not Eugene Carroll's fault. That is not Judge Kaplan's fault. Yes, the jury is gonna know those things, but you know what else? Donald Trump's legal team, the jury is also gonna be aware of everything Donald Trump said and did during four years as president of the United States. They're aware of the comments that he made on January 6th, 2021 at the stop the steal rally. They're aware of the posts that he makes on truth social. 

They're aware of everything the man has done, and there's nothing you can do to change that. For most people, watching the indictments come out of New York didn't necessarily change their opinion of them. For a lot of people, it just confirmed what they had already believed. For the record, this the second time in two business days that Donald Trump's lawyers have been shot down by Judge Kaplan. They were also shot down last Friday when they attempted to get the judge to unmask the jury, which is going to remain anonymous. And the judge of course said no. So they're lost on Friday. They lost on Monday, and now they've got one week till they have to go sit in that trial, where based on their past performances, it's probably a good chance they're gonna lose again. But this one is gonna be very impactful for Donald Trump.",budLight,0.3192965506025326
