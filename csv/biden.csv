'They say I'm ancient': Joe Biden pokes fun at White House correspondents' dinner,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxViSf_jeU&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MPxViSf_jeU/maxresdefault.jpg,Guardian News,http://www.youtube.com/@guardiannews,"Joe Biden, the oldest president in US history, joked about his age as he addressed the White House Correspondents’ Association annual dinner.

The president earned a big laugh when he said: 'They say I’m ancient; I say I’m wise. They say I’m over the hill; Don Lemon would say, ""That’s a man in his prime"".' The CNN host Don Lemon was fired last week after a series of missteps including remarks about the Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley. Biden also poked fun at the media, especially Fox Corp’s settlement of a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5m. 'It’s great the cable news networks are here tonight. MSNBC, owned by NBC Universal. Fox News, owned by Dominion Voting Systems.' For all the comedy, Biden also used his speech to issue forceful denunciations of attacks on press freedom and called for the release of the Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been imprisoned in Russia since March.

Up next: The case for Bernie Sanders: http://bit.ly/2wdX38E

This video is one of a series in which Vox writers argue the cases for the leading Democratic candidates in the 2020 election. (Vox does not endorse individual candidates.)

The case for Bernie Sanders:    • The case for Bern...   
The case for Joe Biden:    • The case for Joe ...  
The case for Elizabeth Warren:    • The case for Eliz...  
The case for Pete Buttigieg:    • The case for Pete...   

And you can read our cases for all the candidates, including Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, at http://vox.com/the-case-for

Former Vice President Joe Biden has been a familiar face in American politics for decades. And he’s built his long career on personal relationships — relationships with fellow Democrats, but also with Republicans. More than any other candidate in this race, Biden’s campaign is defined by his belief that consensus among the parties isn’t only possible. It’s preferable. 

It’s an outlook shaped by Biden’s past experiences, and in an election defined by competing visions of the future, Biden’s nostalgic style stands out. But Vox’s Laura McGann argues that the case for Biden is all about where, and with whom, that moderate, nostalgic message will resonate. Because if you look to the election that won Democrats the House of Representatives in 2018, the message that drove that victory looks a lot like Biden’s.

So: What is that message exactly? What are Joe Biden's politics? And why are so many people convinced he can beat Donald Trump?

According to a new Harvard/Harris poll, the top choices among Democrat and Independent voters are Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke. There’s a lot to take in and a lot at stake, so we checked in with political analyst and blogger Mort Haskell (Fred Willard) in Washington DC. In other news, according to the Department of Agriculture, consumption of canned tuna over the last three decades is down more than 40%. Fewer people are eating tuna out of cans than ever before and the tuna companies are blaming Millennials. We wanted to get to the bottom of this, so we got in touch with the President of the American Tuna Association, Gary Davis (also Fred Willard).

President-elect Joe Biden gets first dose of Covid-19 vaccine,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHCQ3cM02DQ&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VHCQ3cM02DQ/maxresdefault.jpg,CNBC Television,http://www.youtube.com/@CNBCtelevision,"CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" team reports on President-elect Joe Biden receiving his first dose of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi 

President-elect Joe Biden received a Covid-19 vaccine on live television Monday afternoon in a demonstration intended to encourage Americans to receive shots of their own when they can.

“There’s nothing to worry about. I am looking forward to the second shot,” Biden said from a hospital in Delaware.

Jill Biden, the incoming first lady, received a dose of the vaccine earlier in the day. Vice President-elect Sen. Kamala Harris of California and her husband, Doug Emhoff, will be vaccinated next week.

Biden’s vaccination, administered by Tabe Masa, the head of employee health services at ChristianaCare Hospital, comes as officials race to inoculate Americans around the country in the hopes of getting the rapidly spreading virus under control.

Covid-19, which has killed more than 300,000 in the U.S., upended the nation in 2020, freezing large parts of the economy and transforming the traditional process by which candidates campaign for the presidency.

Biden, more than his rival, President Donald Trump, was careful to avoid spreading the virus during the course of his bid, largely eschewing big events and suspending door-to-door campaign activities.

After receiving the vaccine, Biden credited the Trump administration for its work, saying it “deserves some credit getting this off the ground with Operation Warp Speed.”

The former vice president also encouraged Americans to cancel nonessential travel plans and to wear masks.

“We owe these folks an awful lot, the scientists and the people who put this together, the front line workers, the ones who actually did the clinical work. It’s just amazing,” Biden said.

Biden received the first dose of the vaccine made by Pfizer, the first to be approved by U.S. regulators. A second vaccine, made by Moderna, began being shipped around the country over the weekend. Both require two doses to be administered several weeks apart.

Public health officials have said they are aiming to vaccinate as many as 20 million people in the remaining weeks of 2020, but have cautioned that it could be months before most people can receive shots.

Biden, among the first Americans to receive a vaccine, acknowledged that long time frame.

“Now Moderna is going to be on the road as well, but it’s going to take time,” Biden said. “It’s going to take time, and in the meantime — I don’t want to sound a sour note here — but I hope people listen to all the experts.”

Other senior public officials have also been publicly vaccinated in recent days, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump, who was hospitalized with coronavirus in October, has yet to receive a vaccine.

Surgeon General Jerome Adams explained on Sunday that Trump had not received the vaccine because he had recently been treated with monoclonal antibodies.

“That is actually one scenario where we tell people, ‘Maybe you should hold off on getting the vaccine, talk to your health provider to find out the right time,’” Adams said on CBS News.

""MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on Thursday brought up revered Republican President Ronald Reagan in response to a clip of Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz suggesting that President Joe Biden’s mental faculties are “diminished” in a statement on the budget this week.

Speaking at a presser on Wednesday, Cruz said that the reason that President Biden hasn’t taken the same step toward meeting with Republicans on the budget that Vice President Biden did in 2011 is that his “mental faculties are too diminished right now.”*

Donald Trump: Joe Biden's Coronation absence 'disrespectful',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNRIXF9jNhk&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nNRIXF9jNhk/maxresdefault.jpg,The Telegraph,http://www.youtube.com/@telegraph,"President Joe Biden’s absence from the Coronation is disrespectful, Donald Trump said on Wednesday night.

Speaking to Nigel Farage in an interview for GB News, the former president attacked the decision of his ""incompetent"" successor to send Jill Biden, the First Lady, to lead a delegation.

Mr Trump said: ""I don't think he can do it physically, actually. I think that it's hard for him to do it physically, I think, getting over here for him. He's got a lot of things going on, and a lot of strange things happen. But certainly he should be here as a representative of our country.""

He went on to claim Mr Biden would be ""sleeping"" instead of attending the historic occasion. “He’ll be in Delaware where he spends a lot of time… So I don't know, but I was very surprised to see. I think it's very disrespectful for him not to be [attending].""

Whistleblower makes bombshell claim of Biden’s ‘criminal scheme’,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxn0PfJbDVI&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yxn0PfJbDVI/maxresdefault.jpg,Sky News Australia,http://www.youtube.com/@SkyNewsAustralia,"A whistleblower has alleged to US senators that the FBI and Department of Justice possess a document that reveals a criminal scheme involving Joe Biden when he was the vice-president.

The two Republican senators have issued a subpoena for the FBI to hand over the document that allegedly “details an arrangement involving an exchange of money for policy decision”.

""The information provided by a whistleblower raises concerns that then-Vice President Biden allegedly engaged in a bribery scheme with a foreign national,” Senator James Comer wrote in a statement.

The venue is a familiar one for Biden, who attended several as vice president to Barack Obama. The Washington event returned last year after being sidelined by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Biden was the first president in six years to accept the invitation after Donald Trump shunned the event while in office.

Biden took the opportunity last year to take aim at his many critics, including Republicans and the leader of their party: Trump. This year, he is coming not only as the commander-in-chief but as a presidential contender.

US First Lady Dr Jill Biden has arrived in London ahead of the King’s coronation. 

Dr Biden was greeted at 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s wife Akshata Murty. Joe Biden has faced criticism for not attending, although no US President has ever been to a British coronation. 

When Queen Elizabeth II was crowned in 1953, Dwight Eisenhower sent envoys to represent him. 

The White House says President Biden is keen to meet King Charles in Britain at a later date.

US President Joe Biden confirms 2024 presidential bid – BBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo9xfLSGvWQ&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Lo9xfLSGvWQ/maxresdefault.jpg,BBC News,http://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews,"US president Joe Biden has confirmed he is going to stand for re-election in 2024.

Now aged 80 and already the oldest president in US history, Biden had long signalled he would run for another four-year term.

He made the announcement in a promotional video.

In his video, Biden argues that abortion rights, the defence of democracy, voting rights and the social safety net will be among the most important issues on the ballot in 2024.

Former US President Donald Trump has already launched his bid to return to the White House, meaning the pair could be set for a rematch of the 2020 election in November next year.

La decisión de Biden se produce en un momento en el que los grupos criminales se han convertido en un problema creciente en la zona. La frontera oeste de Estados Unidos colinda con los estados de Baja California, Sonora y Chihuahua, una zona que es conocida por ser un corredor clave para la entrada de sustancias ilegales al país.

La orden ejecutiva del presidente autoriza a los Departamentos de Seguridad Nacional y de Defensa a desplegar las fuerzas de reserva que consideren necesarias para combatir a los grupos en la zona. Esta medida permitirá una mayor presencia del ejército en la frontera y una respuesta más efectiva.

De igual forma, se dio a conocer que esta medida es para evitar la llegada de migrantes de forma ilegal al territorio estadounidense, luego de que se anunciaron caravanas que salieron ce Centroamérica con rumbo a EU.

Carta al presidente Joseph Biden sobre financiamiento a organizaciones opositoras e intervencionismo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GQhi5g84uY&pp=ygUJSm9lIEJpZGVu,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2GQhi5g84uY/maxresdefault.jpg,Andrés Manuel López Obrador,http://www.youtube.com/@lopezobrador,"Presidente cuestiona financiamiento de Estados Unidos a organizaciones opositoras al Gobierno de México

El presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador afirmó que el financiamiento que otorga el gobierno de Estados Unidos, a través de la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional (USAID), a organizaciones opositoras al Gobierno de México, “es a todas luces un acto intervencionista, contrario al derecho internacional y al respeto que debe prevalecer entre Estados libres y soberanos”.

En conferencia de prensa matutina, el mandatario dio lectura a la carta que ayer envió a su homólogo estadounidense, Joseph Biden, para informarle sobre el aumento de recursos que dicho organismo anunció, de acuerdo con la página oficial del Departamento de Estado.

“Deseo expresarle de manera breve que desde hace tiempo el gobierno de Estados Unidos, en particular, la Agencia de los Estados Unidos para el Desarrollo Internacional se ha dedicado a financiar a organizaciones abiertamente opositoras al gobierno legal y legítimo que represento. (…) Estoy seguro que usted desconoce este asunto y por ello le pido respetuosamente su valiosa intervención”, leyó ante representantes de medios de comunicación.

Relató que en un principio no consideró enviar la misiva, sin embargo, sostuvo que se trata de un asunto de principios.


“El presidente Biden es una muy buena persona y, la verdad, no nos perjudica políticamente, nos ayuda, sin embargo, hay una cuestión que tiene que ver con los principios y la historia”, aseveró.

“Nos permite aclarar y es didáctico ir dando a conocer cómo es el tejemaneje de la política conservadora, cómo actúan en vinculación con agencias del extranjero, cómo son financiados”, añadió el jefe del Ejecutivo.

Indicó que exponer esta situación es parte de la revolución de las conciencias.

“Lo cierto es que, si informamos a la gente, si informamos al pueblo, no hay problema porque no tenemos nada que ocultar, no establecemos relaciones de complicidad con nadie, no somos corruptos, tenemos autoridad moral. Nada más que hacemos esto, porque, aunque no nos dañe, políticamente hablando, al contrario, al revelar todo esto, la gente se da cuenta, internaliza más lo que hemos venido sosteniendo que son traidores a la patria estos conservadores”, refirió.

Ayer, el presidente López Obrador se reunió en Palacio Nacional con la asesora presidencial para Seguridad Nacional, Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, a quien entregó la carta y recordó que la relación entre México y Estados Unidos se basa en la cooperación y la amistad, pero sin sometimiento ni subordinación.

President Joe Biden addressed the school shooting Monday in Nashville, Tennessee that left three students and three adults dead, calling it ""sick"" and saying the rash of school shootings in the U.S. ""is ripping at the very soul of the nation.""

“We have to do more to stop gun violence. It’s ripping our communities apart. It’s ripping at the very soul of the nation,"" Biden said as he spoke at the start of a women’s business summit at the White House.

A female shooter wielding two “assault-style” rifles and a pistol killed three students and three adults at a private Christian school in Nashville on Monday in the latest in a series of mass shootings in a country growing increasingly unnerved by bloodshed in schools.

Police said they believe the 28-year-old female shooter was a former student at The Covenant School, a Presbyterian school founded in 2001. She also died after being shot by police.

The violence at the school — which has about 200 students from preschool through sixth grade — comes as communities around the nation are reeling from a spate of school violence, including the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, last year; a first grader who shot his teacher in Virginia; and a shooting last week in Denver that wounded two administrators.

Biden called the shooting a “family’s worst nightmare” and implored Congress again to pass a ban on certain semi-automatic weapons.

""...If you hold near and dear to you that you uh um like to be able to um...."" Biden said, before concluding ""anyway.""

Biden then closed his eyes and appeared to struggle to form the next sentence.

However, after seconds of confusion, he quickly told reassured viewers ""we're ready to get a lot done.""

He then appeared to call out a name from a list of White House reporters who were quizzing the president.

Going back to his list at a later point of the conference, Biden asked ""where am I"" before asking CNN's Kaitlan Collins for another question.
