Tim Pool Calls Trump The Greatest President Of His Lifetime,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl_ZXUnqfXg&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bl_ZXUnqfXg/maxresdefault.jpg,The Majority Report w/ Sam Seder,http://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport,"Tim Pool is joined by Libertarian Dave Smith and claims that Donald Trump is the greatest president of his lifetime, which Smith challenges on the international front, given that there were more civil casualties in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen under the Trump administration. The Majority Report crew discusses the dangers of agreeing on a single point by Libertarians. The MR crew also talks about why Libertarian belief in free markets is a gateway to diminishing the size of government and, with that, the regulations of labor and corporate power to an extent.

So Tim Pool sat down with the libertarian commenter and comedian, is he still a comedian? I don't know, I'm not sure.I had a debate with dave smith years ago, I need to go back to that one, yeah I'm curious too. I haven't listened. I mean it was six-seven I don't even know when it was. It was a long time ago,  he seemed like a nice guy but also had libertarian ideas so I imagine that was- but you know he also seemed like a smart guy which if he gonna go on Tim Pool sometimes that tends to be a problem for Tim. Yeah, because even like a smart libertarian is going to be kryptonite for Tim Pool because Tim is going to wade into anything that he doesn't know about. especially one that takes pride in...",timPool,0.7274770124493726

Tim Pool is Helping 'STRAIGHT' Milo Yiannopoulos Make a COMEBACK,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HySaFsiUPIQ&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HySaFsiUPIQ/maxresdefault.jpg,The Kavernacle,http://www.youtube.com/@TheKavernacle,"When we last covered Milo Yiannopoulos, he was not doing well. The former Conservative rising star had a huge fall from grace around 2018, and was fading into obscurity. Last December, he was relegated to being a salesman on a Catholic Shopping Network advertising biblical statues. It seemed a happy ending to his controversial career. 

However, while at rock bottom Milo was given a lifeline. Earlier this year, he was made a intern at the congressional office of Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene. Recently he made an appearance on Tim Pool's podcast which went down very well with Tim's audience. Milo criticised DeSantis and blamed mainstream republicans for sabotaging Trumpian candidates while also spewing the same garbage he always has done. The weirdest part being he has seemingly trained himself to speak in an entirely different voice lol.

00:04:00 - The Rise and Fall of Milo Yiannopoulos 
00:08:30 - Milo worked for Marjorie Taylor Greene 
00:11:50 - Milo and Tim Pool think Women's Rights makes Women very sad 
00:15:20 - Milo and Tim Pool think Elon Musk is a Comedic Genius 
00:18:40 - Milo Still LOVES Trump, hates DeSantis and Ben Shapiro

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

This one person's been aiming with different Tim Pool lyrics and I'm going to read Tim Pool's lyricist. As your heart fell to pieces and to the world you're leaving. for there's only one thing I think you should know. Is that now you can rest in peace dear? That's really his lyrics. Did you not listen to the music video? Oh yes, we did. I missed it when it first came out. I was asked to do it. I think Kowalski called in on Tuesday to ask if he did not ask me about it. And I'd like to listen to a little bit of it. And my biggest complaint was a tweet he put out like a couple days after where he was talking about the success of the song. Like whatever is okay. But he said how people have his song successes makes it clear that people are still hungering for good emo music and not corporate mainstream drivel or whatever. It's like and this is where I'm a stickler. and that is correctly connecting a song to the correct subgenre of music. He did not make an emo song. Is it new metal? radio rock. He made radio rock. If you like that style of music that's great, it's on the radio all the time because it is the most corporatized type of rock music you could make. Which makes his tweet even funnier. But the part that got me was he called it emo. It is not emo. It doesn't sound emo musically. It doesn't sound like emo vocally. Please go listen to some real emo music like Texas is the reason, right of spring, early saves the day, and get an idea of what real emo music is, please. It sounds like it sounds like Daughtry. yeah yeah or Nickelback that's what people were saying.",timPool,0.6609788689260006

LYRICS
Did you think I'd leave you there
Did you think I'd never keep my promise to
It's easy when I'm lyin' there with you
And every night I dream of you
And every night I promise to hold on to
The dream I'll one day wake up next to you

Did you know you left me there
Starin' at the heartache in my soul
As I fell to pieces
And to the one you're leavin' for
There's only one thing I want you to know
Is that I have found my peace here

I only ever wanted you

Did you think I'd walk away
Did you think I'd break my promise, not today
It's easy when I'm standin' there with you
Yet every day away from you
Is another day I break my promise to hold on
Cause holdin' on is harder than I knew

(Cause holdin' on is harder than I knew)

Did you know I left you there
Starin' at the heartache in your soul
As your heart fell to pieces
And to the world you're leavin' for
There's only one thing I think you should know
Is that now, you can rest in peace, dear

I only ever wanted you to stay
I only ever needed you
I only ever wanted you to stay
I only ever needed you
(I only ever needed you)

Did you know I left you there
Starin' at the heartache in your soul
As your heart fell to pieces
And to the world you're leavin' for
There's only one thing I want you to know
Is that now, you can rest in peace, dear

A deep dive reply to Tim Pool's GOOF,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THw1Z9VXY_0&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THw1Z9VXY_0/maxresdefault.jpg,KNIGHTS WATCH,http://www.youtube.com/@KNIGHTSWATCH,"UPDATE 1: Tim has apologized for being arrogant and crass, he has also addressed the cancel culture and free speech issues revolving around Eliza Blue in this IRL episode:    • Timcast IRL - COU...  
IRL has acknowledge they have a responsibility to talk about censorship and admitted several mistakes. This is a much better response than his first apology video and is a good step in regaining my trust.

(Old description)
So I'm aware @Timcast recently claimed to have apologized for. . . well that's the thing, he didn't say a single thing he was sorry for, apart from fighting with @TheQuartering. He has not apologized to his fans, calling them a mob and attacking them without justification. I'm more than happy to change my opinion if he shows sincerity and addresses things. So far Tim has taken no ownership over the things he said, he has not retracted anything, has not addressed the issues about Eliza Blue and why he avoided talking about the censorship and free speech issues, run damage control for her and still has an inflammatory article on his website that's a puff piece for Eliza and attacks YouTubers as ""leeches"", ""digital cannibals"" and said ""it wasn't even worth it"" to ask anyone who got censored their side of the story.
So please forgive me if I'm dubious about Tim's sincerity at this point. His ""apology"" seems more like an attempt to distract people away from his recent actions, making people think he's sorry when it more appears he's doubled down again and is trying to distract people from that fact.

""It was only three months after the Democratic Party’s 2010 electoral “shellacking” when Vice President Joe Biden found himself in Kentucky keynoting a conference about the US Senate. There were few people better qualified to talk on the subject: Biden had spent virtually his entire adult life in the body and was one of the most outspoken proponents of its culture of chummy dealmaking. Topics ranged from its foundations and evolution to the influence of antebellum political giant Henry Clay, “The Great Compromiser” who had staved off civil war through a series of famed bargains that also had the effect of extending the life of slavery.

Biden was on enemy territory. He was speaking at the behest of the University of Louisville’s McConnell Center, which, like the Papa John’s Cardinal Stadium on whose third floor he prepared to deliver his remarks, drew its name from the source of its corporate funding: Mitch McConnell, Kentucky’s longest-serving senator, who had ascended to the Senate Republican leadership over a twenty-six-year-long career founded on his unparalleled ability to raise money from powerful interests. McConnell, who would be speaking alongside Biden, was also the chief architect of the “shellacking” Biden’s party and administration had just received.""

This is where he brought up the conversation when we started to bring up the Buffalo Shooting. He just did not seem to want to talk about the actual Buffalo Shooting.
so exactly he goes back to hypotheticals. That is his number one rhetorical strategy. and hypotheticals. 
And there was no there wasn't hypothetical to do with the marvel universe so he had to get creative.
And treat people of color in a way that they weren't treated before. Treat them better.
Do you think that's what white people talk about when they talk about their shared history? How to treat people better? Or do you think they talk if they're.
If they're getting together in an anti-racist group then yeah I do.
So if you took a bunch of white people because I could tell you that the shooter is not going to an anti-racist affinity group. 
So this is anti-racist classroom a program from schools. They're not going to the students and saying we're having, they're saying we're having white.
When when you're not just having units letting them sit down and start talking about white power. You're sitting them down and you're guiding a discussion into what white privilege is.
What do you think happens when a group of young white kids sit down and talk about white history? What do you think they do? What do you think they say to each other?
What do you mean they talk about?
What sort of you do you think they say things like man we're awful? or do you think they say things like Leif Erickson’s awesome. 
Who's who, they probably don't say either of those things.",timPool,0.6267785903702936

How Tim Pool Keeps His Audience Ignorant,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2OPuxfWpaE&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/c2OPuxfWpaE/maxresdefault.jpg,José,http://www.youtube.com/@JoseBird,"Here we are, back with Tim Pool once again. He's one of those black holes of misinformation that I couldn't help but get pulled back. This was supposed to be a much smaller video, but clearly I had a lot to say. And quite a bit had to be cut. I would have more time to really dig into Tim content in a kinder (crueler?) world, but this is the only world we've got.


The original version of this video started off with a fun joke about someone asking me if I was going to spend another week watching Tim Pool videos, and I asked if they were making some kind of threat. It was good. But reality means we don't get to be funny, so now there's a disclaimer about the Capitol attack on January 6th.

Due to a lot of quick updates, and the timeliness of this video, the overall product is a little rough around the edges compared to some of my other videos. But if no one notices that, let's just say my videos were never very slick to begin with.

Tim Pool is a very successful journalist.

He has millions of subscribers on multiple channels. 

Yet Pool never went to journalism school. In fact, he didn’t even finish high school.

Pool became a respected reporter, just by doing it--going there and covering things the mainstream media miss.

He’s reported from global hotspots, gone into the middle of riots, and exposed media bias.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...""

Thank you to Tim Poole and his crew for hosting me and inviting me. They should extend that invitation to a lot more people on the left. Because looking at the views and interactions and engagement that that video has received on his channel it's much more than a lot of his recent other interviews with his usual lineup of guests. And I think there's a reason for that. So you know he should have more people on if he's open to doing that. and again thank you for hosting me. 
That's kind of a surprise though because it could go the other way. I feel like sometimes when people go on Rogan like I think burgess's broken appearance was maybe I'm wrong about this but my impression was that that underperformed. So it's interesting like I'm looking here. What does that say? How many can you read that Emma?
Nearly 500 000. 483. There you go. Look at that.
And the comment section is even not I'm gonna talk about the content in the comments section. But compare how many comments my discussion with Tim has received. Even compare it interestingly enough Jamie Kilstein was on the next episode the next day. Check out those comments.s check out comments from last week. Usually gets like two thousand three thousand comments on these live streams. Like I'm talking about after not the chat like the comments left on the video. And last I checked on my episode there were 13,000 comments.
Whoa, talk about engagement.
Here's one or one of the top liked replies 227 likes I absolutely love it when a hardcore leftist comes on. The discussion is never boring. Good job guys.
Good job I was perusing the comments a little earlier too and unsurprisingly a lot of Tim Poole fans like to put abstract quotes from philosophers and others in the replies. As opposed to talking about I don't know specific policy sets.
That it's good or bad that Twitter has this specific policy he's just saying that on the issue of transgenderism Twitter has clearly taken aside and their side is that a person's gender identity is a concept that supersedes their biological identity that's the decision they made as a platform which is a politically biased decision I mean they're basically saying trans people exist though because.",timPool,0.6049277914175262

""Kanye West stormed out of an interview Monday night with podcaster Tim Pool, who mildly pushed back on the rapper’s overt and non-stop anti-Semitism.

West is currently presiding over a failing business empire over his continued and escalating attacks against Jews. Last week, the rapper was accompanied to Mar-a-Lago by White nationalist Nick Fuentes. Far-right troll Milo Yiannapoulos reportedly introduced the pair.

All three were in the studio with Pool, but the interview was cut short after roughly 20 minutes when the host offered muted pushback against West’s unrelenting attacks against Jews.""

Tim Pool's Human Centipede Of Bad Takes Explained By Timbah On Toast,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjcm3VuifLo&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yjcm3VuifLo/maxresdefault.jpg,The Majority Report w/ Sam Seder,http://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport,"​@TimbahOnToast ’s video on @Timcast breaks down why his content is garbage and why Pool deviates so much from facts. The Majority Report crew laughs at Tim Pool’s claim that dating apps are the reason that there is a shortage of economically attractive males. Pool is sure that dating apps allow for women to find older men, though census data suggests that women are increasingly marrying men who are closer in age, and surveys about online dating suggest the same trend.

Sam Seder: Did anybody watch the Timbah on toast video yet?
 
Matt Lech: I watched it in its entirety and I think there might be more parts coming in the future and I can't wait Timbah is the best in the business.

SS: All right let's play a clip this is um from the video Tim Pool chaotic news analyst by YouTuber Timbah On Toast released on August 9th. Timbah On Toast, I watched the first like I don't know...maybe half of this and we're really just sort of like uh puts to lie the idea of like who Tim is relative to who he presents himself. 

ML: He takes Tim at face value and then judges him by that criteria and it's so well done 

SS: Here's a brief clip of that. We gonna play it?

ML: Yeah it's about three minutes

Tim Pool: It could have been bad, actually it wasn't bad it was the Russians that's right. Not only did the Russians want to get Donald Trump elected apparently the Russians want us all to believe that Star Wars is a bad movie...",timPool,0.5967238891044843

Regarding Binder’s appearance on Pool’s show, am I supposed to believe that Pool has a moral reason for avoiding you now because of the Crowder Ethan thing? The guy once crashed Cenk’s South by Southwest forum. Dressed as him and mocking his weight. He’s using that Ethan event as a cowardly excuse. Also, today is my birthday… I haven’t seen this, Matt said that at one point- It was a three-hour interview, at one point Pool said come back and come back with a guest and Matt said well maybe I’ll bring back Sam Seder. And apparently, Tim Pool was so offended that I showed up in that Steven Crowder debate that he won’t have me back on. Tim Pool asked me to do a show and this was pre-vaccines. I don’t know when it was, summer 2021? He said Covid’s over. He asked me to come on the show and said sure I’ll do it, and I went into his DMs- This was a few months before the Crowder thing. It was also pre-vaccine.",timPool,0.5610738885970136

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski’s show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.

“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”

And yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”

It’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode.

""Marrero belongs to a growing cohort of women who are putting off motherhood or forgoing it entirely. As a result, many are advancing further in their careers than prior generations and entering a new frontier of wealth. 

Single women without kids had an average of $65,000 in wealth in 2019, compared with $57,000 for single, child-free men, according to new research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. For single mothers, the figure was only $7,000.

Parenthood was losing its appeal even before Covid-19, and the hardship brought on by the pandemic appears to have accelerated the trend. A Pew Research Center study last year found that 44% of Americans age 18-49 who don’t have kids say it’s not too likely or not at all likely they will procreate someday—an increase of 7 percentage points from 2018.""

The Journalism Revolution: Tim Pool (Future of StoryTelling 2013),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UkKd9wawhRU&pp=ygUIVGltIFBvb2w%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkKd9wawhRU/maxresdefault.jpg,Future of StoryTelling,http://www.youtube.com/@FutureofStoryTelling,"http://www.futureofstorytelling.org

""I had a cell phone, that's about it, when Occupy Wall Street started."" 

That didn't stop Tim Pool from filming everything he saw and live streaming it online during the emotionally fraught, physically violent, culturally cathartic climax of Occupy Wall Street. 

He quickly amassed hundreds of thousands of followers who watched his footage, tweeted about it, shared it, commented on it, and used it to build a much more complete picture of what was actually happening than the story being told by mainstream media. Big news corporations began to use his footage, and soon, Pool's cell phone videos became an intrinsic part of the way the world saw Occupy Wall Street. 

Mobile ""phone-and-drone"" journalism is changing the way news is disseminated. As he explains, the balance of power between journalists and witnesses is changing—in harnessing the power of social media, telling the story becomes a collective undertaking.

Crowder doesn't think Kanye is really anti-semitic but that his language is imprecise. He thinks there are some things Kanye gets right: ""Look is there a conversation to be had about secular humanists with Jewish last names in Hollywood exploiting people in positions of, you know, the performance arts talent? Yeah! is there a disproportionate number of people with Jewish last names in higher banking? That's an argument that can be made.""

Manuel Chavez AKA Defango seems to have been libeled and slandered throughout by alleged past connections to different political groups possibly opening up defamation questions.

Defango has the chance to explain what actually went down from the time the article went up, to his conversations with Shane and Cassandra Macdonald. Not only has Part 3 come down, but the entire series on Eliza Morthland has been removed. Of course Eliza Bleu aka Cuts aka Knows aka Siep aka Morthland has been under fire for what seems to be censoring twitter accounts like Brittany Venti, The Quartering, Yellow Flash, and Camelot among others. Additional YouTube accounts have had videos removed on her behalf including Chrissie, Venti, Faran Balanced, Quartering, That Umbrella Guy and many others 
From Simpcast 62. SimpCast stars Chrissie Mayr, Nina Infinity, L aka Some Bitch I Know, Aly Drummond, XRay Girl, and Defango

Song Lyrics:
We follow, we follow until it’s our turn to die
We’re slowly marching to our suicide
instead of living tell me what to do
instead of dreaming let me die for you

If I could see the darkness in the minds
And their tainted eyes, I'd make it right

We're marching, we’re marching to the beat of genocide
We're killing at the whims and tides
Of a nation fractured at the seams
Breaking apart for the world to see

Break free from controlled reality
And fight your way from this
To get away from it

I'm losing my mind have I lost my sight
If this quicksand has gone over my eyes
How can I see anything

We're shadows, we're shadows in the current enterprise
Of institutions made to control your lives
We’re inside breeding, concocting all the lies that we use
To control your minds

Break free from controlled reality
And find your way from this
To get away from it

I'm losing my mind have I lost my sight
If this quicksand has gone over my eyes
How can I see anything

But I cannot find a better way
From all the better things
That you give to me

Oh no, not I
Could not find a better way
From all the better things
That you give to me

If I could see the darkness in the minds and their tainted eyes, I’d make it right

Responding to criticisms of recording Jeremy Boreing's phone conversation, Crowder says it's only okay for people like James O'Keefe to use tactics like that to expose corruption on the left and not the right. Crowder goes on to claim that The Daily Wire is completely misrepresenting the amount of money that Crowder was asking for, and how it would be distributed in the contract.

Tim Pool & Chicks on the Right are Being ATTACKED for NOT Covering Eliza Bleu?

Chrissie Mayr takes a chance at seeing the situation between all sides of the Eliza Bleu, social media censorship, & vocal debating happening online. At the end of the day it is not about excuses, but about just taking a moment to attempt a level of understanding that would allow this to not devolve in to a schism, but a collaborative journey of unique people of all types. We must at least stay on target in this world of many problems & at least focus on the censorship happening on social media. Tim Pool and The Chicks on the Right both are being attacked and to some extent, harassed for their lack of coverage over Eliza Bleu, Brittany Venti, The Quartering, the Twitter and YouTube censorship and more
