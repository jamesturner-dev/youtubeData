RELATED: Fox News parts ways with top-rated conservative host Tucker Carlson https://bit.ly/3LbJaLo

Lemon expressed frustration with the manner in which he says the news was delivered to him.

""After 17 years at CNN I would have thought that someone in management would have the decency to tell me directly,"" Lemon added in his tweet. ""At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear there are some larger issues at play. With that said, I want to thank my colleagues and the many teams I have worked with for an incredible run. They are the most talented journalists in the business, and I wish them all the best.""

‚ÄúIn a statement, CNN CEO Chris Licht thanks Don for his contributions over the past 17 years, writing in part, ‚ÄòDon will forever be a part of the CNN family. We wish him well. And we‚Äôll be cheering him on in his future endeavors,‚Äù she said.

Harlow said Lemon ‚Äúwas one of my first friends here at CNN.‚Äù

Young Turk (n), 1. Young progressive or insurgent member of an institution, movement, or political party. 2. Young person who rebels against authority or societal expectations. (American Heritage Dictionary)

The Young Turks (Winner - Best Political Podcast & Best Political News Site of 2009) were the first original talk show on Sirius satellite radio and the first live, daily webcast on the internet. But that is not the revolution.

We are a rare show that combines all of the news that people care about in one place. We are not afraid to talk about politics and entertainment and sports and pop culture. But that is not the revolution either.

The real revolution is in daring to be honest with people. We don't patronize our viewers or lie to them. We have real conversations and deliver the news honestly.

Dr. Rashad Richey and Rickey Smiley discuss on Indisputable. Tell us what you think in the comments below. 

Read more here: https://www.motherjones.com/politics/...

""Could a blossoming kinship, forged in the fire of unceremonious dismissals on the same day, be developing between Tucker Carlson and Don Lemon? 

Maybe. That‚Äôs one of the big takeaways from Brian Stelter, who reports for Vanity Fair that the two men, in addition to retaining the same entertainment lawyer, have reportedly exchanged several texts in the last few days. The content of those messages isn‚Äôt yet known, but I have a feeling they hit the same notes as the statements the two men put out since getting canned: stunned, chaotic, and fuming.""

*** 

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we‚Äôre taking steps to stop it because we don‚Äôt want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it‚Äôs the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that‚Äôs not coming from us.

We‚Äôre told that people who are the ‚ÄòGrand Prize Winner‚Äô need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it‚Äôs really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

2. SOUNDBITE (English) Kelly McBride, SVP Poynter Institute:
""This is a performance issue, right? And this one's a little more clear cut. It's pretty clear that CNN is pushing him out. And and ultimately, it's not technically about the performance, but it's about whether the audience and the guests were going to follow him along and they were getting pushback. I read in The New York Times from some really good reporting that was published there today, they were getting pushback from guests who didn't want to appear with Don Lemon. And then also, he wasn't he wasn't pulling as well with the audience.""

5. SOUNDBITE (English) Kelly McBride, SVP Poynter Institute:
‚ÄúThey are rebranding, right? They're clearly going in a different direction with their different leadership and they're sort of refitting the plane while they're flying it, which Fox is probably going to have to do, too. So I think it sort of remains to be seen. This has more to do with the ouster of Zucker and the changing of visions. Right. So there's there's a new vision for what CNN is taking place right now, is taking shape right now. And it's not as critical for CNN. Their audience is personality driven, but not as much as Fox as audience. And it's more for them production and tone and like, what do they want the different products to feel like? And they are they are trying to figure that out.""

STORYLINE:
Longtime CNN host Don Lemon is out at the cable news network a little over two months after apologizing to viewers for on-air comments about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, CNN announced Monday

‚ÄúCNN and Don have parted ways,‚Äù CNN chair and CEO Chris Licht said in a memo to staff that was also posted on the network's communications Twitter account. ‚ÄúDon will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.‚Äù

CNN did not provide a public explanation for Lemon's departure. But on the ‚ÄúCNN This Morning‚Äù co-host's own Twitter account, Lemon contended the news came as a surprise to him and characterized it as a firing. He had appeared on his show that morning.

‚ÄúI was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN. I am stunned,‚Äù he wrote in a statement posted shortly after 12 p.m. Eastern. ‚ÄúAfter 17 years at CNN I would have thought that someone in management would have the decency to tell me directly. At no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network.‚Äù

Around 45 minutes later, CNN issued a rebuttal on its PR account: ‚ÄúDon Lemon‚Äôs statement about this morning‚Äôs events is inaccurate. He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter.‚Äù

Lemon's ouster came the same day that Fox News announced it was abruptly parting ways with its most popular host, conservative personality Tucker Carlson.

SUBSCRIBE: ¬†¬†¬†/¬†@famous_entertain...¬†¬†

CNN news host Don Lemon may be from Louisiana, but these days, he shares a stunning retreat in The Hamptons, with his fianc√© and partner, Tim Malone. A few years ago, he selected a white, neoclassical, clapboard mini-mansion in the area of Sag Harbor to settle down in, and soon after moving in, carried out a renovation on the home so it would suit his tastes. Before finding his 2,750-square-foot dream property and calling it home ‚Äì Don previously lived in a spacious condo located in uptown New York City. He sold this place in 2021 for $1.5 million with the help of his fianc√© Tim who was one of his realtors as well. On choosing his current home, Don claims that the area in fact, chose him. He said:‚ÄúI think Sag Harbor chose me. When I saw it, I knew I wanted to live there‚Äîit was like I was always supposed to be there."" And the rest was history!

Now even White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has chimed in on CNN 's Don Lemon's sexist comments about women not being in their 'prime' past their 40s. Asked about Lemon's comments, which were made about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley on Thursday, Jean-Pierre said at Friday's briefing that 'that is something clearly that need to be addressed.' She wouldn't take a direct slap at Lemon, who  co-hosts CNN This Morning, but used the opportunity to highlight President Joe Biden 's own record of elevating women - which includes a number of women older than 40.

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski‚Äôs show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers ‚Äî loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

‚ÄúDo you like Kyle Kulinski?‚Äù

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

‚ÄúHe understands what we‚Äôre up against,‚Äù Ahmed said. ‚ÄúLike Bernie.‚Äù

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski‚Äôs name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski‚Äôs show struck me as mostly capital-P ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù takes on the news ‚Äî the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It‚Äôs an impression that wasn‚Äôt entirely incorrect.

‚ÄúI have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,‚Äù Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about Lenin. I don‚Äôt want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.‚Äù

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do ‚Äî even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚Äù

And yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚Äù

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode.

The venue is a familiar one for Biden, who attended several as vice president to Barack Obama. The Washington event returned last year after being sidelined by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Biden was the first president in six years to accept the invitation after Donald Trump shunned the event while in office.

Biden took the opportunity last year to take aim at his many critics, including Republicans and the leader of their party: Trump. This year, he is coming not only as the commander-in-chief but as a presidential contender.

Don Lemon‚Äôs ratings-challenged ‚ÄòCNN This Morning‚Äô gets shakeup | New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F87mbsn_Izc&pp=ygUJRG9uIExlbW9u,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F87mbsn_Izc/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,http://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"CNN tapped two veteran executive producers on Monday to oversee Don Lemon‚Äôs ratings-challenged and controversy-marred ‚ÄúCNN This Morning.‚Äù

Longtime CNN producer Lauren Mensch and Chris Russell, who recently was the executive producer for NewsNation‚Äôs ‚ÄúOn Balance with Leland Vittert,‚Äù will grab the reins from Eric Hall, according to the cable news network.

The moves come amid a flurry of bad publicity for Lemon. The host infamously put his foot in his mouth last month by claiming GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley was not ‚Äúin her prime,‚Äù which not only upset co-anchors Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collin but ignited a firestorm of criticism that led to Lemon publicly apologizing and being sent to ‚Äúformal training.‚Äù

His tone-deaf remark was ridiculed Sunday by Michelle Yeoh in her acceptance speech after the 60-year-old Malaysian star won the Oscar for Best Actress.

Don Lemon Nearly CRIES Over Colbert Joke About Him | The Kyle Kulinski Show,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxUu1L3aF8U&pp=ygUJRG9uIExlbW9u,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hxUu1L3aF8U/maxresdefault.jpg,Secular Talk,http://www.youtube.com/@SecularTalk,"Support The Show On Patreon!:

""The first time I ever really listened to Kyle Kulinski‚Äôs show was in the back of a cab last summer. The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers ‚Äî loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.

‚ÄúDo you like Kyle Kulinski?‚Äù

The driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.

‚ÄúHe understands what we‚Äôre up against,‚Äù Ahmed said. ‚ÄúLike Bernie.‚Äù

But I was surprised to hear Kulinski‚Äôs name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski‚Äôs show struck me as mostly capital-P ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù takes on the news ‚Äî the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.

It‚Äôs an impression that wasn‚Äôt entirely incorrect.

‚ÄúI have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,‚Äù Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear about Lenin. I don‚Äôt want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.‚Äù

With over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do ‚Äî even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski‚Äôs.

While Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski‚Äôs fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he‚Äôs closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.

But unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks ‚Äî who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago ‚Äî the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on ‚Äúthe Millennial Left‚Äù pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski‚Äôs name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of ‚Äúthe Squad‚Äù to power.

Just last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? ‚ÄúThere is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,‚Äù according to one moderator. In new media, he‚Äôs king ‚Äî the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he‚Äôs nobody.

I suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing ‚Äúcool‚Äù about Kulinski‚Äôs show. (As a friend put it, ‚Äú‚ÄòWelcome to Secular Talk‚Äô sounds like something you‚Äôd hear on Egyptian radio.‚Äù) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won‚Äôt get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as ‚ÄúDirtbag Left.‚Äù Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. ‚ÄúNot only have I not attended one,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúI have no idea what that means.‚Äù

And yet he‚Äôs astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan‚Äôs wildly popular show, introduced them. ‚ÄúYou make the most sense to me,‚Äù Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a normal person.‚Äù

Much like Sanders himself, Kulinski‚Äôs show has a massive audience that just doesn‚Äôt compute with our media‚Äôs understanding of ‚Äúwhat the kids want‚Äù or even ‚Äúwhat the left-wing kids want.‚Äù

It‚Äôs probably for the best ‚Äî the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. ‚ÄúCorporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all ‚Äî class issues,‚Äù he said on a recent episode. ‚ÄúThat Raytheon decided they don‚Äôt hate gays or trans people ‚Äî frankly, I don‚Äôt really give a shit what their take on that is...""

""Don Lemon stepped in it again Monday, apparently making what he thought was an off-mic remark about Jon Stewart and then, after an awkward pause, backtracking big time.

Don threw to a clip of Jon Stewart interviewing U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, in which Stewart challenged what he called extreme waste in the DOD's $850 billion budget. When Hicks took issue with the waste allegation, Jon shot back ... ""I can't figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps. To me, that's f***ing corruption.""""

CNN‚Äôs Don Lemon appears to slight Jon Stewart during hot-mic moment | New York Post,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ2h1mPqVKI&pp=ygUJRG9uIExlbW9u,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zZ2h1mPqVKI/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,http://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"CNN‚Äôs Don Lemon appeared to dis Jon Stewart during a hot-mic moment ‚Äî saying the former ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù host has more ‚Äúleeway‚Äù as a comedian following Stewart‚Äôs tense exchange with a Pentagon official.

During a segment on ‚ÄúCNN This Morning‚Äù Monday, a clip was played of Stewart, 60, interviewing US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks about the military‚Äôs inability to take care of service members despite its $850 billion budget.

‚ÄúIf I give you a billion dollars, and you can‚Äôt tell me what happened to it? That to me is wasteful. That means you are not responsible,‚Äù he told Hicks. ‚ÄúBut if you can‚Äôt tell me where it went, then what am I supposed to think?

‚ÄúWe got out of 20 years of war and the Pentagon got a $50 billion raise. Like that‚Äôs shocking to me now,‚Äù Stewart continued.

‚ÄúI may not understand exactly the ins and outs and the incredible magic of an audit, but I‚Äôm a human being who lives on the Earth and can‚Äôt figure out how $850 billion to a department means that the rank and file still have to be on food stamps.

The comment was followed by a few seconds of awkward silence, making it appear that Lemon believed he was speaking to his co-anchors off-air.

Lemon then appeared to try frantically backtrack.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just discussing that Jon Stewart is so much more than a comedian ‚Äî he‚Äôs a thought leader,‚Äù he interjected.

ASSOCIATED PRESS
New York ‚Äì 26 April 2023
1. Don Lemon and Tim Malone posing for photographers
2. Don Lemon posing for photographers
3. SOUNDBITE (English) Don Lemon, former CNN Anchor:
‚ÄúI do understand that. But I understand what's important right now, especially for where I am at this event is for to celebrate the people who are here, who deserve to be celebrated and not to talk about what's going on with me.‚Äù
4. Don Lemon talking to reporter
5. SOUNDBITE (English) Don Lemon, former CNN Anchor:
(Reporter: Don, what gave you the strength to land on your feet the way you did?) 
‚ÄúI'm already on my feet. Look (jumps).‚Äù
(Reporter: ""You seem upbeat, and a lot of people will be down in a week like this. How do you stay up?"")
Don Lemon: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, I - Why would I be down?‚Äù
(Reporter: ""You lost your job."") 
Don Lemon: ""I'm a very, very fortunate person. I didn't lose my job. I'm good"" (pauses for a moment) ""I didn't lose my job. I lost my sister. A job is something that is not as important as a person.‚Äù 
(Reporter: ‚ÄúSo, you know what's important in life?‚Äù) 
Don Lemon: ‚ÄúYes, I know what's important in life.‚Äù
6. Gayle King talking to reporter
7. SOUNDBITE (English) Gayle King, news anchor:
(Reporter: In terms of television journalism what a week with some major departures. Is accountability at play or is this something more in your eyes?)
‚ÄúI mean, accountability always matters. Always. Regardless if you're on television and you're delivering the news, accountability matters. And it's unusual that you would see the one two knockout punch that we saw this week. But I think it's a wakeup call for many people, for many people. I just know at CBS. I'm not worried about where we sit and how we deliver the news. I feel very proud of the job we do. And I'm not just schmoozing CBS. I really do mean that.‚Äù 
8. Stephanie Ruhle posing with Mia Farrow
9. SOUNDBITE (English) Stephanie Ruhle, news anchor:
‚ÄúListen, I don't know firsthand what happened at CNN or Fox News. I don't work at either organization. All I know is I got to keep my head down and keep grinding because our goal is to try to help people get better and smarter every night. And there might be disinformation cannons shooting from TV networks across the street. But what we can do is tell the truth every damn night.‚Äù
10. Ronan Farrow on red carpet
11. SOUNDBITE (English) Ronan Farrow, television personality:
‚ÄúI did do a lot of reporting on January 6th rioters. And, you know, I think on the Fox News front, there's been a lot of discourse, appropriately, about them putting falsehoods out into the discourse. That's a meaningful problem in our politics. And it does fuel violence and division. So that's not a problem just on the right. I think that's a problem across the media. But it is probably promising that that conversation is triggering meaningful corporate action.‚Äù 
12. Don Lemon and Tim Malone posing for photographers

PRODUCER: John Carucci
STORYLINE:
Days after television journalist Don Lemon was fired from CNN, he made an appearance at the Time 100 Gala, and when asked about the dismissal, put events firmly into perspective.

Lemon walked the red carpet with partner Tim Malone, Wednesday (26APRIL2023) in New York, and briefly spoke to some news outlets.

When asked about landing on his feet by attending the event, Lemon responded: ‚ÄúI'm already on my feet,‚Äù before taking a jump.

Lemon was adamant that he was upbeat, despite being dismissed from his job as an anchor for the network. 

‚ÄúI'm a very, very fortunate person. I didn't lose my job. I'm good,"" pausing for a moment before going on to elaborate.

Sharon Reed and Yasmin Aliya Khan discuss on Indisputable. Tell us what you think in the comments below. 

Read more here: https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/cnn-...

""Back in 2008, Don Lemon was co-anchoring CNN‚Äôs ‚ÄúLive From‚Äù weekday show with Kyra Phillips, a gig that he landed after he arrived at the network two years prior from local news in Chicago. For months, tensions between the pair kept mounting. On more than one occasion, a ‚ÄúLive From‚Äù producer and a newsroom supervisor had to pull Lemon off the air during a commercial break because of the anchor‚Äôs provocative antics, not unlike his recent declaration that the 51-year-old Nikki Haley isn‚Äôt a viable presidential candidate because she ‚Äúisn‚Äôt in her prime.‚Äù Amid the charged atmosphere, sources say Lemon disrespected colleague Nancy Grace on the air and Soledad O‚ÄôBrien during an editorial meeting attended by roughly 30 staffers.""

*** 

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we‚Äôre taking steps to stop it because we don‚Äôt want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it‚Äôs the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that‚Äôs not coming from us.

We‚Äôre told that people who are the ‚ÄòGrand Prize Winner‚Äô need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it‚Äôs really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

Several audience members have reached out to share that there is an impostor of Dr. Rashad Richey and Indisputable. This person is posing as Dr. Richey or as the Indisputable channel and telling viewers that they have won a prize and to download WhatsApp or Telegram to get the prize. 


Let me set the record straight here because this is totally false, and we‚Äôre taking steps to stop it because we don‚Äôt want you to be affected by the scam: 


Indisputable with Dr. Rashad Richey is a VERIFIED channel on YouTube. You will know that it‚Äôs the REAL channel communicating with you if you see the check mark next to our channel name on YouTube. 

We are not running a giveaway promotion via WhatsApp or Telegram. Please do not give anyone your personal information on WhatsApp or Telegram to claim a prize because that‚Äôs not coming from us.

We‚Äôre told that people who are the ‚ÄòGrand Prize Winner‚Äô need to pay to claim the prize. That is not a promotion administered by Indisputable or TYT. That is an impostor. 


We are responding on our end to protect our viewers from these scams. In the meantime, when you come across an impostor please report it and then email support@tyt.com to let us know. Again, the Indisputable channel on YouTube has a verified check mark so please look for that to know that it‚Äôs really our team communicating with you. 

Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.

‚ÄúI'm already on my feet. Look (jumps).‚Äù
(Reporter: ""You seem upbeat, and a lot of people will be down in a week like this. How do you stay up?"")
Don Lemon: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, I - Why would I be down?‚Äù

#NBCNews #TuckerCarlson #DonLemon",donLemon,0.5928085789237981
Don Lemon fired from CNN weeks after Nikki Haley comments,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dDbKGHUByo&pp=ygUJRG9uIExlbW9u,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/6dDbKGHUByo/maxresdefault.jpg,WUSA9,http://www.youtube.com/@WUSA9news,"CNN said Monday that longtime anchor Don Lemon is out at the cable news network ‚Äî a move that Lemon characterized as a firing. The news comes weeks after Lemon apologized for comments he made on-air about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley.

""I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN. I am stunned,"" Lemon wrote on social media Monday. ""After 17 years at CNN I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly.""

About half an hour later, CNN's communications Twitter account called Lemon's statement ""inaccurate"": ""He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter.""

Earlier, the account shared a memo to staff from CNN chair Chris Licht confirming that the network had ""parted ways"" with Lemon: ""Don will forever be a part of the CNN family, and we thank him for his contributions over the past 17 years. We wish him well and will be cheering him on in his future endeavors.""

Lemon had appeared Monday on ""CNN This Morning."" In his social media statement, he said he was never ""given any indication"" that the alleged dismissal was coming, and that it was ""clear that there are some larger issues at play.""

Lemon, one of CNN's most recognizable personalities, faced widespread criticism in February for comments about 51-year-old Haley's age. While discussing politicians' ages with co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, he said Haley wasn't ""in her prime."" He went on to say that a woman is considered to be in her prime in her 20s, 30s and maybe her 40s. 

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt shoot the messenger, I‚Äôm just saying what the facts are,‚Äù Lemon said after Harlow challenged his statement and asked for clarification.

He issued a statement the same day saying he regretted his ‚Äúinartful and irrelevant‚Äù comments and was absent from the show for three days. He returned the next week and posted an apology on Twitter: ""To my network, my colleagues and our incredible audience ‚Äî I'm sorry,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúI've heard you, I'm learning from you, and I'm committed to doing better.‚Äù

Licht told staff members in a memo ahead of Lemon's return that the anchor would undergo unspecified training. He said it was important that the network balance accountability with fostering a culture in which people ‚Äúcan own, learn and grow from their mistakes.‚Äù

Lemon was switched from his own prime-time show when a revamped ‚ÄúCNN This Morning‚Äù was launched in November, one of Licht's biggest swings since taking control of the network last year.  The show hasn't had the intended ratings effect, and CNN leadership urged patience last month amid downturn in viewership across the board.

Haley called Lemon's comments sexist in February and referred to them in fundraising appeals. In a Monday Twitter post after Lemon's ouster, she said it was ""a great day for women everywhere"" and linked to a campaign website selling beverage sleeves that reference the incident.

It was Monday's second major TV shakeup ‚Äî Fox had just announced a sudden split from controversial primetime host Tucker Carlson.

""Don Lemon won‚Äôt be on for the President‚Äôs Day broadcast of ‚ÄúCNN This Morning‚Äù after his comment about 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley and women‚Äôs ‚Äúprime‚Äù last week.

The CNN anchor, who later apologized for the remark, took a scheduled day off work on Friday before his seemingly not-planned day off on Monday, sources told multiple outlets.

Lemon has faced criticism since Thursday for his comment to his co-anchor Poppy Harlow about Haley not being in ‚Äúher prime‚Äù ‚Äî a time he defined as a woman‚Äôs 20s, 30s and maybe 40s.

Lemon was scheduled to work Monday before a schedule sent out by CNN on Sunday afternoon revealed that Sara Sidner would hold his anchor spot instead, as first reported by The Daily Beast‚Äôs Confider.""

We should mention Don Lemon went to listen. I also want to say this. What's that guy Tim? Heidecker. Yeah. On Friday we'll probably have Tim Heidecker on so he wants to debate me about the relative merits of Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo I guess. So we'll have that guy on. He has been now accusing me of slander. I probably will, I mean frankly, I accuse him of slander for accusing me of slander. It's a vicious cycle. see you in court. Yeah, I am rubber he is glue. Let's put it that way. Here is Don Lemon. This is supposedly you know the interview that got him fired. I don't think so. Apparently, this was in the works for quite some time and Don Lemon knew it. I gotta be honest I don't really care that much about Don Lemon. But this was a fun interview to watch him get mad. And Clearly, the producers have been in this situation where you have an earpiece in to listen to The Producers. The producers are saying Don't please stop, please stop, don, don't let him, we want to talk about China. And Poppy Harlow is sitting next to him like oh this is off the rails. It's pretty funny. around China. I don't see what one has to do with the other. but go on. I took up a lot of time with Fox. Oh, it's fine. I don't really see what one has to do with the other. It's best to consider and use the Civil War to talk about Black Americans. That war was not fought for black people to have guns. That's not because the war was brought for black people to have freedoms in this country. Actually, that's why the Civil War was fought. Okay for black people to have guns. I think actually you know the funny fact is black people did not get to enjoy the other freedoms until their second amendment rights were secured. And I think that that's one of the lessons that we aren't allowed to enjoy. for one second. I mean you know we don't we haven't seen the front part but the concept and you know that the guy is talking about the Second Amendment being used to provide black people with freedom in the wake of the Civil War is completely ahistorical. That's what the Gettysburg Address was about. Black people can now buy guns at their local gun dealers. The second amendment was largely a vehicle to make sure that people could go track down black people. Yeah. Who had essentially tried to escape slavery? And also when the Black when black panthers were open carrying that was the first time you saw a CR well the crack in the gun lobby which has exploded. Where there was support for gun control. Ronald Reagan employed it. Yes, but to be clear what you're talking about in the Civil War was a hundred years apart from each other. Almost exactly.",donLemon,0.5748236886011325

Well it‚Äôs the beginning of the week, and this podcast is now your only source for accurate news after both Don Lemon and Tucker Carlson have been fired. Over the weekend Demaris had a non-vip concert experience with a bumpy bathroom experience. Speaking of bumps, we react to Usher saying he‚Äôd do a Super Bowl Halftime show. Weekend 2 at Coachella has finally come to a close (sans Frank) and Latto used her performance to address some beef. Staying on beef, Jim Jones continues to pester Pusha T in a recent interview which prompts a subtle response from Pusha. We continue to reminisce about past beef which moves Rory (pause). Julian drops another random celebrity interaction, while 11-year-old Rory annoyed Benzino at a Miami Heat game. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as, the Knicks moving one game closer to the second round, Tank vs. Ryan Garcia, + more!

The news comes after Variety published a story earlier this month on allegations that he mistreated his female colleagues over the course of his career there. And earlier this year, he faced backlash over widely criticized comments he made on-air.

Don Lemon is issuing a mea culpa after saying former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley isn't ""in her prime."" 

During Thursday's episode of ""CNN This Morning,"" Lemon and his co-hosts discussed Haley's comments during her presidential campaign announcement that called for ""mandatory mental competency tests for politicians over 75 years old."" The 51-year-old politician launched her bid in the Republican race at a rally Wednesday in Charleston, S.C.

Speaking to co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, Lemon, 56, said Haley's ""talk about age"" makes him uncomfortable and said her comments were the ""wrong road"" to go down, adding that Haley ""is not in her prime.""

Lemon, who was recently forced to undergo sensitivity training after he made sexist comments on the air about GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley‚Äôs age, is described in a damning expos√© by Variety as a malcontent who frequently engaged in ‚Äúdiva-like behavior.‚Äù

According to Variety, Lemon sent threatening, anonymous text messages to colleague Kyra Phillips because he was jealous that she was assigned to cover the aftermath of the US invasion of Iraq.

‚ÄúNow you‚Äôve crossed the line, and you‚Äôre going to pay for it,‚Äù read one message sent to Phillips‚Äô phone from an anonymous number that was later reportedly traced to Lemon.

According to Variety, CNN, which conducted an investigation of the texts, removed Lemon from his co-anchoring duties alongside Phillips and demoted him to weekends.

News of the explosive incident made its way up to CNN CEO Chris Licht, who is said to have been appalled by Lemon‚Äôs behavior, according to a source. A second source said a producer talked to Lemon at the behest of Licht and told the anchor to take the next day off to ‚Äúcool off.‚Äù

Don Lemon Benched on Monday Over Sexist Remark Scandal, Insiders Say - https://www.thedailybeast.com/don-lem...

""Don Lemon will not appear Monday on CNN This Morning as his future on the show continues to be discussed at the highest levels within the network, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Lemon, who was forced to make a groveling apology to CNN staffers on Friday after making offensive remarks about women and aging, had been scheduled to anchor This Morning alongside co-hosts Poppy Harlow and Kaitlan Collins, according to a copy of the CNN anchor schedule obtained and reviewed by Confider.

But by Sunday afternoon a new on-air lineup schedule was sent out by CNN management that had the show being anchored by Harlow and Sara Sidner in New York with Collins in Poland, according to two people familiar with the matter.""

Fox's Tucker Carlson & CNN's Don Lemon Fired On The Same Day,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hty5utmlnL0&pp=ygUJRG9uIExlbW9u,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/hty5utmlnL0/maxresdefault.jpg,The Majority Report w/ Sam Seder,http://www.youtube.com/@TheMajorityReport,"Tucker Carlson, the most-watched host on cable news, has left Fox News, according to a report from The New York Times. Carlson's exit comes after months of speculation about his future at the network. In recent months, Carlson has been embroiled in a number of controversies, including his promotion of false claims about the 2020 election and his criticism of the COVID-19 vaccine.

In a statement, Fox News said that it had ""mutually agreed to part ways"" with Carlson. The network did not provide any further details about the decision. Carlson's departure is a major blow to Fox News. He was the network's most-watched host, and his show, ""Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" was the most-watched cable news show in the country.

It is unclear what Carlson's plans are after leaving Fox News. He has not yet announced any new projects. It is also unclear what impact Carlson's exit will have on Fox News. The network has been facing declining ratings in recent years, and Carlson's departure is likely to accelerate that decline.

Meanwhile, CNN has fired Don Lemon, one of its most prominent anchors, according to a report from The New York Times. Lemon's firing comes after months of controversy, including comments about women and aging. In February, Lemon made headlines for saying that former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley isn't ""in her prime.""

Lemon has also been accused of making other offensive comments about women on air in the past. In 2017, he was criticized for saying that women who wear short skirts are ""asking for it.""

ON-CAMERA CONFLICT: Watch the Tense Moments That Caused Dust-Up Between CNN‚Äôs Kaitlan Collins and Don Lemon - https://www.mediaite.com/tv/on-camera...

""The set of CNN This Morning has taken on a frosty air amid tensions between co-hosts Don Lemon and Kaitlan Collins.

The off-camera tensions spilled into public view this week thanks to a report from the New York Post alleging that the cast and crew of the recently launched morning show are ‚Äúrattled‚Äù due to conflict stemming from a December 8 broadcast. The Post‚Äôs Alexandra Steigrad reports:

Tensions on the set of ‚ÄúCNN This Morning‚Äù have recently boiled over, with Don Lemon allegedly ‚Äúscreaming‚Äù at co-host Kaitlan Collins off-camera during an ugly December incident that has left the cast and crew rattled ever since, The Post has learned. According to two sources with knowledge of the situation, the 56-year-old Lemon approached 30-year-old Collins following the show‚Äôs Thursday Dec. 8 broadcast ‚Äî and unloaded on her in front of staffers as he accused her of ‚Äúinterrupting‚Äù him on air.

CNN issued a statement to Mediaite regarding the report: ‚ÄúThe Post‚Äôs account is wildly overblown and two months old. Don, Kaitlan and Poppy were friends before they were co-anchors and they remain friends today.‚Äù""
