Geraldo ERUPTS At Greg Gutfeld Over Abortion Rights,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkeqIubPnKc&pp=ygUHZ3V0ZmVsZA%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/lkeqIubPnKc/maxresdefault.jpg,The Young Turks,http://www.youtube.com/@TheYoungTurks,"Geraldo Rivera got into a pretty heated debate with Greg Gutfeld on Fox News's The Five about abortion rights and how Trump’s Supreme Court Justices flat out lied during their confirmation hearings. Gutfeld’s main criticism relied on women on social media supposedly “bragging” about getting abortions, going back to the old talking point of demonizing women who have had an abortion, and shaming women who express their bodily autonomy. Cenk Uygur and Adrienne Lawrence discuss on The Young Turks. Watch LIVE weekdays 6-8 pm ET. http://youtube.com/theyoungturks/live

""Debate on Fox News’ The Five got heated on Wednesday, as Geraldo Rivera and Greg Gutfeld exchanged unpleasantries while discussing abortion.

On Monday, Politico published the leaked draft of a pending Supreme Court opinion slated to overturn Roe v. Wade, which established a constitutional right to abortion. Written by Justice Samuel Alito, the draft says the issue should be left for the states to decide.

Rivera, who is pro-choice, slammed Republicans who have reacted by expressing outrage at the leak instead of at the impact it will have on women. He also accused Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett of lying at their Senate nomination hearings about how they view Roe.

“What this shows is that the Senate confirmation process by which a nominee is interrogated by both parties and give their reasons why they are fit to be on the high court, is absolutely deeply flawed,” Rivera said.

“Why? Because these nominees lied. They go before the Senate of the United States, they swear that they are going to be judicious and good shepherds of the court and its impartiality in the importance it has in the American society, and that the stare decisis says, that the precedent of these cases is well established,” he argued.""

A Reagan Forum with Greg Gutfeld — 11/16/15,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KodQTWcLuI&pp=ygUHZ3V0ZmVsZA%3D%3D,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2KodQTWcLuI/maxresdefault.jpg,Reagan Foundation,http://www.youtube.com/@ReaganFoundation,"Please join us for a lecture and book signing with bestselling author and Fox News Channel host Greg Gutfeld for his new book, How to be Right: The Art of Being Persuasively Correct.  (Publish Date: October 27, 2015).  Tickets are $54 per person and include a dinner preceding the lecture.  Tickets also include tours of the Reagan Museum and Air Force One Pavilion, including the Library’s special exhibits Football! The Exhibition and Christmas Around the World between 4:00 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.  Books must be purchased at the Reagan Library’s Museum Store to receive signature.  Books may be pre-purchased during the reservation process, register by calling 805-522-2977 or visit http://home.reaganfoundation.org/site....

It's not enough to be right, these days—especially when you're not left. To survive, the right must learn how to express nonliberal principles as effectively as possible, and persuade others of their point of view. It is an art that demands patience, research, humor, understanding, creative thinking, learning from your opponent and even mimicking their tactics.
 
In How to Be Right, Greg Gutfeld reveals the strategies that have helped him keep a steady job for almost three decades.  From “Discard Your Outrage” and “Outcompassion Them” To “Find the Right’s Obama” and “Use your Mom,” Gutfeld gives readers the tools they’ll need to argue, influence, and convince their friends, family and foes throughout the 2016 election cycle.

Greg Gutfeld currently serves as the host of The Greg Gutfeld Show and co-host of The Five on Fox News Channel.  He’s also the New York Times bestseller of The Joy of Hate and Not Cool.

Here is Greg Gutfeld. This is the five reacting I guess to somebody who had said you know looking for people to be less critical of drug workers online. In New York state I can just tell you that the Cannabis industry in New York State is huge. Helps Farms start to see like you know retail outlets open up. I think New York is probably one of the best states in terms of the way they've approached legalization. there have been some hiccups there was a lawsuit that was you know inhibiting like the opening of some dispensaries. But it is hard for old people like me and Greg Gutfeld, particularly guys like Red Garfield, to sort of get used to the notion that something illegal for our entire lives is now legal. Yeah. Even though I know I was engaging in that substance in high school. which is, you know, basically longer than I've been engaging in just about anything at this point. But I don't know if he did. I'm sure he did probably things that are still illicit if you have to ask me although I don't know. But I would guess that some of the people at Fox News have tried cocaine before. Just a guess. Yeah, I'm sure somebody has. here's Greg Gutfeld. The new migrants. We don't call them. I don't know I don't think it's as glamorous. I mean do you go to a car repair shop? Instead of a car dealer. You know when you go to a casino they're called dealers now. We're called sex workers, not sex sellers. Yeah. You're absolute. Right look I think you should Target the cartels while you negotiate with them. And I also think you've got to legalize drugs. I mean the only way you're gonna have quality control like prescriptions and the only way you're going to stop fentanyl poisonings would be to legalize these drugs which people want. The problem isn't with the dealers. The problem is with us. Right? We're the demands. they're just the supplier. Oh, you know what you want you to want to know who the drug dealers are? Snoop Dogg was a drug dealer named Jesse. Jay-Z was a drug dealer. 50 Cent was a drug dealer. Mark Wahlberg was a drug dealer. Tim Allen. and you know who opened this segment oh Kid Rock was a drug dealer. So I'm telling you there's a lot of hypocrisy. This is an artificial stance. Okay, there's a lot of hypocrisy from Republicans. What do they love and preach to everybody? Capitalism. What do they hate? Regulating it. What is the drug market unregulated capitalism? The first rung to that ladder of capitalism often is drug dealing for blacks. So how dare you.",gutfeld,0.5936400214319995
