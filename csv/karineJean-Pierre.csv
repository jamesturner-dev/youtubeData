"Psaki introduces Karine Jean-Pierre as 1st Black, LGBTQ White House secretary",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dnEpqDkES0&pp=ygUSS2FyaW5lIEplYW4tUGllcnJl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5dnEpqDkES0/maxresdefault.jpg,Global News,http://www.youtube.com/@globalnews,"On Thursday, current White House press secretary Jen Psaki introduced her incoming successor Karine Jean-Pierre, who will be the first Black and openly LGBTQ person to serve as the public face of a U.S. administration.

Psaki, who leaves the job on May 13, had previously said she planned to stay in her role with the Biden administration for approximately one year, which started in January of 2021. Following her departure, Psaki is expected to become a TV host at MSNBC.

Jean-Pierre has served as deputy press secretary since the beginning of U.S. President Joe Biden's term. She worked on his 2020 presidential campaign, in President Barack Obama's White House, and was chief public affairs officer for MoveOn.org, a progressive advocacy group.

Biden has pledged to name top officials, cabinet members and judges who reflect the diversity of America, where white people make up less than 60% of the population but have traditionally held the majority of top government jobs.

(Nov. 4, 2019)

About Moving Forward:
An inspiring political memoir from Karine Jean-Pierre, chief public affairs officer for MoveOn, chronicling her path from New York’s Haitian community to working in the Obama White House, and offering a blueprint for anyone who wants to change the face of politics.

Most political origin stories have the same backbone. A bright young person starts reading the Washington Post in elementary school. She skips school to see a presidential candidate. In middle school she canvasses door-to-door. The story can be intimidating. It reinforces the feeling that politics is a closed system: if you weren’t participating in debate club, the Young Democrats and Model UN you have no chance.

Karine Jean-Pierre’s story breaks the mold. In ""Moving Forward,"" she tells how she got involved, showing how politics can be accessible to anyone, no matter their background. In today’s political climate, the need for all of us to participate has never been more crucial. This book is her call to arms for those who know that now is the time for us to act.

---------------------------------------
About Karine Jean-Pierre:
Karine Jean-Pierre's professional experience has ranged widely from presidential campaigns to grassroots activism, to local politics, to working in the White House. Jean-Pierre is the Chief Public Affairs Officer for MoveOn.org and an NBC and MSNBC Political Analyst. Jean-Pierre previously served as the Deputy Campaign Manager for Martin O’Malley for President.

Karine Jean-Pierre claims Biden ‘parolee’ program decreased illegal immigration by 90% | NY Post,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waijfHfzpiU&pp=ygUSS2FyaW5lIEplYW4tUGllcnJl,https://i.ytimg.com/vi/waijfHfzpiU/maxresdefault.jpg,New York Post,http://www.youtube.com/@nypost,"White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was slammed by critics after boasting Monday about the Biden administration’s humanitarian “parolee” program for asylum seekers from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti and Venezuela — as the US preps for a fresh surge of migrants at the southern border.

“You’ve seen the parolee program be so successful,” Jean-Pierre said during her press briefing. “It has, it has, it has, when it comes to illegal migration, you’ve seen it come down by more than 90%, and that’s because of this act — the actions that this president has taken.”

The program, instituted in October for Venezuelans and extended to residents of the other three countries in January, has allowed 30,000 asylum seekers who followed the legal application process to be admitted to the US each month.

Migrants from those countries who showed up at the border without applying for the process were swiftly expelled.

The program had contributed to an overall drop in enforcement encounters at the border, from a record high of 252,012 people in December to 156,787 in January. By March, however, that number had bounced back to 191,899, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which had not yet released numbers for April.

As Jean-Pierre tried to introduce the cast of ""Ted Lasso,"" who were visiting the briefing room to discuss mental health, a reporter began shouting at her. 

Simon Ateta, a reporter for Today News Africa, accused Jean-Pierre of ignoring reporters in the back of the briefing room. He also accused Jean-Pierre of making a mockery of the first amendment.

Video shows that as Jean-Pierre tried to respond and move on, the reporter continued to shout over her.

His actions drew loud rebukes from several members of the press corps. 

After the cast departed, Jean-Pierre called the outburst ""totally unacceptable"".
